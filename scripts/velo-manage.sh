# VELO Management Script
# ==============================================================================
#
# This file is TRACKED in the repo, next to the frontend and backend it
# manages -- it is not generated once at provisioning time and then left to
# drift. `velo update` (below) pulls it like any other file: a fix landed here
# reaches every server on the next update, the same way a backend fix does.
#
# It used to be a ~700-line block embedded identically inside THREE separate
# installer scripts, written to /opt/velo/scripts/manage.sh once at install
# time and never touched again. A bug fixed in the repo (fda4b9e, 2026-07-16)
# therefore never reached a server that was already provisioned, and a second
# instance of the exact same bug (backend `build app`, below) shipped
# unnoticed in the very same file. Moving the script here removes that failure
# mode by removing the copy: there is only one text now, and it is the text
# that runs.
#
# Reached through a thin shim at /opt/velo/scripts/manage.sh (installed once
# by scripts/install_velo.sh, never edited again): the shim does nothing but
# `exec` this file. See install_management_shim() in that script.
#
# Reads the two values that legitimately differ per server --
# DOMAIN_FRONTEND, DOMAIN_API -- from /opt/velo/velo.conf, written once at
# install time. Everything else (which branch, which secrets) is read live
# from the git checkout or backend/.env, not baked in here -- baked-in values
# are what made the old manage.sh three divergent copies instead of one.

# PROMPT №563: a key missing from the real .env is only genuinely DRIFT if

# class gives every field a Python-side default (grep confirms: zero fields
# declared without one, e.g. via pydantic's `Field(...)` -- checked, none
# exist in this file today), but those defaults are NOT uniformly "safe":
# some are real, working values (TELEGRAM_LINK_DOMAIN = "telegram.me") and
# some are empty-string placeholders that only LOOK like defaults
# (SECRET_KEY = "", DATABASE_URL = "" -- "no default in production, app
# won't start without it", per that field's own comment). Only the first
# kind gets downgraded to informational; an empty/None default still counts
# as drift, unchanged from before.
#
# Derived from the code by a regex read of config.py, not a hand-maintained
# list -- so it tracks new fields automatically. HONEST LIMITS: this is a
# regex over a Python source file, not a parser. It only resolves a field
# declared as `snake_case_name: type = <literal>` on a single line (true for
# all 93 fields in this file today, verified by grep). A future field using
# `Field(...)`, a computed default, or a multi-line annotation would not
# match and SAFELY falls back to being reported as drift (never silently
# downgraded on a declaration this couldn't confidently read). It also can't
# tell "safe in every environment" apart from "safe for local dev, wrong in
# prod" (e.g. REDIS_URL defaults to localhost) -- that distinction exists
# only in this file's prose comments, not as a machine-readable signal, so
# such keys are informational too. Informational still PRINTS (with the
# default shown) so a human doing a prod audit still sees it -- only the

#      CONFIRMED, now unreachable -- even the deadline fallback, which exists
#      precisely to stop a booking sitting undecided forever, is reached only
#      through the same NULL filter.
#
