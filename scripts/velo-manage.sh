# SUSPENDED for a command's exit status inside an `if`/`while`/`&&`/`||`/`!`
# context -- verified directly: a failing command inside a function invoked as
# `if ! some_function; then ...` does NOT trip -e, and the function keeps
# running past it. run_frontend_tests() below is called exactly that way, so

# whose exit code went unread, reporting success on stale code). Every command
# whose failure matters is checked EXPLICITLY instead, right where it runs.

# VELO Management Script
# ==============================================================================
#
# This file is TRACKED in the repo, next to the frontend and backend it
# manages -- it is not generated once at provisioning time and then left to
# drift. `velo update` (below) pulls it like any other file: a fix landed here
# reaches every server on the next update, the same way a backend fix does.
#
# It used to be a ~700-line block embedded identically inside THREE separate
# installer scripts, written to /opt/velo/scripts/manage.sh once at install
# time and never touched again. A bug fixed in the repo (fda4b9e, 2026-07-16)
# therefore never reached a server that was already provisioned, and a second
# instance of the exact same bug (backend `build app`, below) shipped
# unnoticed in the very same file. Moving the script here removes that failure
# mode by removing the copy: there is only one text now, and it is the text
# that runs.
#
# Reached through a thin shim at /opt/velo/scripts/manage.sh (installed once
# by scripts/install_velo.sh, never edited again): the shim does nothing but
# `exec` this file. See install_management_shim() in that script.
#
# Reads the two values that legitimately differ per server --
# DOMAIN_FRONTEND, DOMAIN_API -- from /opt/velo/velo.conf, written once at
# install time. Everything else (which branch, which secrets) is read live
# from the git checkout or backend/.env, not baked in here -- baked-in values
# are what made the old manage.sh three divergent copies instead of one.
#
# Usage: velo {command} [options]
