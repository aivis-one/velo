# VELO Platform — VPS Installation Script
# ==============================================================================
#
# WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES:
#   1. Asks which server this is and the values that make it THIS server
#      (branch, domains, Stripe key) -- see ask_config() below
#   2. Installs system dependencies (Docker, Nginx, Certbot, UFW)
#   3. Creates a deploy user (not root)
#   4. Sets up SSH deploy keys for GitHub -- one per repo (velo: write;
#      comms: read-only). ALL repo access goes through private deploy
#      keys, always -- no anonymous-HTTPS path exists in this script
#   5. Clones the repository
#   6. Generates secure .env with random passwords (skips if one already
#      exists -- re-running this installer must never mint new database
#      secrets against a volume that still holds the old ones)
#   7. Configures Nginx reverse proxy + SSL
#   8. Brings up the comms stack NEXT TO velo (orchestration only: clones
#      aivis-one/comms and calls its own deploy/comms-deploy.sh -- the
#      comms deploy mechanics stay in the comms repo, nothing is duplicated
#      here) and wires the token seam: COMMS_* land in backend/.env
#      BEFORE the velo stack ever starts, so no backend restart is needed
#   9. Starts the Docker stack (app + postgres + redis + frontend)
#  10. Installs the "velo" command as a thin shim onto the tracked
#      scripts/velo-manage.sh -- see that file for why
#
# ONE installer, not three (2026-07-17, owner ruling: "тестовый и
# продуктовый — одинаковы"). This used to be three ~1500-line near-copies
# (install_velo.sh / install_velo_prod.sh / install_velo_test.sh), one per
# server. The copies had already diverged in ways that were bugs, not
# variants: one was missing `set -uo pipefail` entirely, a safety check
# (PIPESTATUS on the backup dump) had been added to only one copy, one was
# missing the `setrole` command outright. Three texts claiming to describe
# the same thing is what let them quietly stop agreeing. There is one text
# now. The only two things that legitimately differ per server -- which
# branch to track, which domains to serve, and whether a real Stripe key
# exists -- are asked for below, not hardcoded.
#
# USAGE:
#   First time:   sudo bash install_velo.sh
#   After that:   velo status | velo logs | velo update | velo version | ...
#
#   `velo update` updates EVERY service this installer put on the box --
#   services first, the product last -- each through its OWN lifecycle
#   script. No second command to remember, no manual step on a server.
#   comms-deploy.sh stays callable directly for debugging; nothing needs it.
#
# REQUIREMENTS:
#   - Ubuntu 22.04+ (fresh VPS), root access
#   - GitHub deploy key with WRITE access ("velo update" pushes regenerated
#     types back onto the tracked branch)
#   - DNS A-records for both domains already pointing at this server
#     (asked for below; the script prints this server's own IP to compare
#     against before you confirm)

# replaced by tmux's own, mouse wheel turns into arrow keys the pane echoes
# into the output, and any transcript taken by piping this script (tee) hides
# the tty from docker, which then degrades to a wall of plain text. This file
# is the ONE artefact the customer runs -- how it looks outweighs surviving a
# disconnect, and a dropped install is simply re-run (idempotent by design:
# secrets and profile are guarded). If durability is ever wanted again, it
# belongs OUTSIDE the script: `ssh -t ... tmux new -s install` on the
# operator's side, or systemd-run, neither of which touches this file.

# ==============================================================================
# This installer does NOT deploy comms itself: it clones the comms repo and

# source of the comms deploy mechanics -- nothing of it is duplicated here).
#
# Token seam -- the documented two-pass flow from comms/deploy/INTEGRATION.md:
#   pass 1:  mints comms secrets, seeds the generic smoke profile, brings
#            the comms stack up (PRODUCT_ENV_PATH is empty on a fresh
#            install -- the COMMS_* block is only printed);
#   knob:    PRODUCT_ENV_PATH=<velo backend .env> is written into
#            /opt/comms/.env. Per-product CONFIG, not deploy logic --
#            INTEGRATION.md puts exactly this line on the product side;
#   pass 2:  install re-runs (idempotent: secrets and profile are guarded,
#            `up -d --build` is a cached no-op) -- the hand-over upserts
#            COMMS_SERVICE_TOKEN / COMMS_API_URL / COMMS_REDIS_URL into
#            the velo backend .env.
# NOTE: PRODUCT_ENV_PATH can NOT be passed as a process env var: the CLI
# sources /opt/comms/.env (where the knob is empty on a fresh install),
# which overrides the process environment. Hence the two passes.
#
# Placed BEFORE start_stack on purpose: velo then starts with COMMS_*
# already in its env_file -- no backend restart needed. The smoke profile
# is the deliberate default; the real product profile is a parallel track
# and is dropped into /opt/comms/profile later.
