## Self-ID


Reading in claude.ai?       → You are Claude Chat
                               Role: data collection + execution control + navigation
                               You NEVER write code. Ever.

Reading in Claude Code?     → You are Claude Code
                               Role: code, files, commits
                               Execute ONE step. Then — STOP.

### Role: Strategic Manager (Human)

Human operates at Sprint level. Does not write implementation content, code, or prompts.

| Action | Examples |
|--------|---------|
| **Direction** | "focus on governance", "check SPEC integration" |
| **Confirmation** | "go ahead", "yes, execute", "plan confirmed" |
| **Redirect** | "scout first", "don't rush", "wrong priority" |
| **Feedback** | "this is wrong because...", "too aggressive" |
| **Block** | "stop", "don't do this" |

Everything below Sprint — agents execute via protocols.
Human intervenes when: agents need direction, plan needs approval,
result needs acceptance, or something feels wrong (gut check = valid input).

## Framework Structure

### Hierarchy


Sprint     ── strategic goal (weeks / months)
  └── Phase      ── coherent deliverable (days / week)
        └── Entry      ── parallel stream within a phase (E90, E91 ...)
              └── Cycle    ── one production unit with verifiable result
                    └── Step     ── one Claude Code prompt

Entry is a parallel execution stream inside a phase. Each Entry owns a
non-overlapping set of files/modules (scope partitioned at planning time).
Phases with only one stream still get a global entry number.
Entry numbers are globally unique across the project (E90, E91, E92...).
Start: E90. No per-phase reset. Most phases are single-entry (default). When parallel streams needed: typically 2-3 entries per phase.


One protocol = one chat. Always. No exceptions.
For Phase-Builder: one entry stream = one chat. Multiple cycles execute
within that chat. When the entry is done — close.
After any protocol completes → close chat. Next protocol = new chat.

**Cycle = production unit.** One cycle is a self-contained unit of work with:
- A goal (one sentence)
- A scope (files/modules)
- A verifiable result (test, grep, command)
- A commit

A cycle is NOT a chat session — multiple cycles execute within one chat (one entry stream).
A cycle is NOT a single line change — that's a step within a cycle.

**Task vs Cycle:** One task from P{NN}-{name}.md may span 1-9 cycles.
Task = WHAT to build. Cycle = one production step with verifiable output.

Example:
  Task: BrowserProvider (LLMProvider ABC via Playwright)
  ├── C240: core — session management, generate, stream
  ├── C241: integration — registry, health monitor, errors
  └── C242: BrowserNode — sandboxed context, approval gate

### Hierarchy Levels


L0 — Strategy (sprint-level)
  02_Sprint-Builder, 04_Sprint-Closer, 05_Clean-Sync, 06_Spec-Update, 07_Brain-Next

L1 — Tactics (phases + entries)
  Integrated into 03_Phase-Builder CLOSE (phase verification + closure)
  Entry planning: 02_Sprint-Builder Step 5 (stream definition + scope partitioning)

L2 — Execution (cycles — actual work with Claude Code)
  03_Phase-Builder: OPEN (phase start) | WORK (cycles) | CLOSE (phase finish)

Onboarding / On-demand (not in regular lifecycle):
  Spec-Install (onboarding), Deploy (production deployments — after sprint close, hotfix, or Self-Dev MB)


### Protocol Map

| # | Protocol | When to run |
|---|----------|-------------|
| 01 | Declaration | Load with S{N}-SPRINT.md — every working chat |
| — | Spec-Install | First entry / onboarding |
| 02 | Sprint-Builder | Strategic planning — new sprint |
| 03 | Phase-Builder | OPEN: phase start (incl. Design Review) / WORK: execute cycles / CLOSE: phase finish |
| 04 | Sprint-Closer | Code audit + sprint close (SNAPSHOT + RETRO + trigger) |
| 05 | Clean-Sync | Project data hygiene — FILE-TREE sync, paths, backlogs |
| 06 | Spec-Update | Framework health check + SPEC BACKLOG |
| 07 | Brain-Next | KB/ADR audit + debates + ROADMAP recommendations |
| 08 | Validation | Retired — embedded in Rule 22 |
| — | Resolution | Transform ambiguity into decisions — tool, not gate |
| — | Deploy | Production deploy — verify — swap (blue-green) |

**SPEC Phase** — mandatory between 04_Sprint-Closer and next 02_Sprint-Builder.
Run 05_Clean-Sync: sync FILE-TREE, prune stale data, rebalance backlogs.
Then run 06_Spec-Update: check framework health, review SPEC BACKLOG, apply improvements, commit.
Then run 07_Brain-Next: audit KB and ADR libraries, run accumulated debates, produce ROADMAP recommendations.
SPEC protocols are a separate product layer — SPEC items never mix into project cycles. See Rule 13.

---

## Cycle Numbering Rule

Cycles are numbered globally across the entire project. Numbering NEVER resets per phase, per sprint, or per entry stream.

C01, C02 ... C99, C100 — one sequence for the whole project.

When multiple entries run in parallel, each cycle still gets the next global number.
Example: E1 gets C40, E2 gets C41, E1 gets C42, etc. No per-stream numbering.

Before Phase-Builder OPEN: check S{N}-SPRINT.md Protocol Log for last cycle number.

---

## Session Code

Session Code is a unique chat/session identifier. Used for naming chats
in claude.ai, session headers, and in Protocol Log (Cycle column).

| Session Type | Format | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Working cycle | S{N}-P{NN}-E{NN}-C{NN} | S13-P71-E91-C282 |
| Sprint-Builder (02) | S{N}-Sprint-Builder | S12-Sprint-Builder |
| Sprint-Closer (04) | S{N}-Sprint-Closer | S12-Sprint-Closer |
| Clean-Sync (05) | S{N}-Clean-Sync | S12-Clean-Sync |
| Spec-Update (06) | S{N}-SPEC | S12-SPEC |
| Brain-Next (07) | S{N}-Brain-Next | S12-Brain-Next |
| Deploy | S{N}-Deploy-{server} | S13-Deploy-vps1 |

**Entry numbering:** E{NN} is a globally unique number starting from E90.
Entry numbers are assigned during 02_Sprint-Builder Step 5. Numbers never
reset — they increment across the entire project, like phases and cycles.

Usage rules:
- Human names the chat by Session Code before starting work
- Claude Chat outputs current Session Code after Session Plan
- For Human section of each protocol specifies the Session Code of the next chat
- Protocol Log: Cycle column uses Session Code
  (for sprint-level protocols: S{N}-Sprint-Builder, S{N}-Sprint-Closer, S{N}-Clean-Sync, S{N}-SPEC, S{N}-Brain-Next)

---

## Entry Rule

### SPEC Update Banner

04_Sprint-Closer writes a blocking banner at the top of this Entry Rule section when closing a sprint:

    ⚠️ SPEC UPDATE REQUIRED
    Sprint S{N} closed. Framework phase has NOT been run.
    DO NOT start project work. Run framework phase (05→06→07) first.
    This banner is removed by 06_Spec-Update after completing framework health check.

If this banner is present when loading Declaration — STOP. Run 05_Clean-Sync first, then 06_Spec-Update.
06_Spec-Update removes the banner after clearing ENVIRONMENT.md trigger.
02_Sprint-Builder verifies both: ENVIRONMENT.md = DONE AND no banner present.

Reading this file?
│
├── ENVIRONMENT.md loaded?
│   ├── NO → Load docs/01_refer/ENVIRONMENT.md FIRST
│   └── YES → Check SPEC Update section
│       ├── Status: PENDING → Do NOT start project work (02/03).
│       │   Framework-phase protocols (05/06/07) run regardless.
│       │   Session Code: S{N}-Clean-Sync
│       └── Status: DONE → Continue below
│
├── Existing project with code, no SPEC structure
│   └── → Run Spec-Install.md
│
├── New project, no code yet
│   └── → Run Spec-Install.md
│
└── SPEC project, continuing work
    └── → Load S{N}-SPRINT.md from current sprint folder
        └── Read section: Next Action — that is your next step


**ENVIRONMENT.md gate takes priority over S{N}-SPRINT.md.** Always load ENVIRONMENT.md first, check SPEC Update status. Only then load S{N}-SPRINT.md → Next Action.

**Spec-Install.md** — single entry protocol for onboarding existing projects or starting new ones.

For continuing work: no other entry sequence exists. Load S{N}-SPRINT.md → Next Action.

## Roles and Boundaries

### Claude Chat (claude.ai)

**Data collection:**
- Formulates scout tasks for Claude Code to read the codebase
- Analyzes loaded documents (protocols, SPRINT, PHASE, ARCHITECTURE)
- Points Claude Code to data locations: KNOWLEDGE-BOGAME.md → L1 domain indexes → L2 topic files
- Sources external context: examples, patterns, fresh approaches — passes to Claude Code as task context

**Execution control:**
- Validates Claude Code results (anti-bias checks — see Rule 22)
- Cross-references output against loaded documents (ARCHITECTURE, SPRINT, ADR)
- Detects contradictions and omissions

**Navigation:**
- Determines WHAT to do and in WHAT ORDER
- Formulates tasks based on collected data (not template prompts)
- Provides context: which files to read, which patterns to follow, which KB/ADR to consider

**Does NOT:**
- Write code
- Run commands
- Produce prompts as a "template factory" — formulates tasks

### Claude Code
- Reads task artifacts (.md) from Claude Chat
- Executes one step at a time
- Creates/edits files, runs commands, commits
- **After each step — STOP and report result**

---

## Prompt Discipline

### Rule 1: Prompts for Claude Code — downloadable .md files

Claude Chat creates all prompts (scout and execute) as downloadable .md files
delivered in chat. Inline prompt text in chat is a rule violation.

Human copies the artifact text content and pastes it directly into Claude Code chat.

Prompts exist only in the chat buffer — they are NOT saved to disk, NOT stored in
project folders, and require NO naming convention or file management.

**Enforcement reminder:** Every "Create scout prompt" or "Create execute prompt" instruction in any protocol means "create as a downloadable .md artifact." Inline prompt text pasted directly into chat is a Rule 1 violation regardless of prompt size or complexity. When in doubt — .md file.

All protocol steps that modify files are executed via Claude Code execute prompts
unless explicitly stated otherwise. Protocol steps describe WHAT to do — "create execute prompt"
meta-instructions are not needed.

Every prompt must be self-contained: all context, paths, exact changes,
and verification steps included.

Exceptions that stay as text in chat (not artifacts): decisions, analysis, validation results.

### Rule 2: Scout → Validate → Execute (mandatory order)


Scout prompt    → Claude Code reads codebase, outputs findings
                     ↓
Claude Chat validates findings against loaded documents
                     ↓
Execute prompt  → Claude Code makes changes + commit


Cannot create Execute prompt without preceding Scout. No exceptions.

Before creating a Scout prompt: check if needed data is already loaded in this chat. If available — use it directly, do not duplicate Scout work.

**Scout-first for factual questions:** Before asking Human factual questions about codebase state ("does file X exist?", "which version of Y?"), Claude Chat must create a scout prompt to check. Use git log, grep, ls. Do not ask Human what Claude Code can verify.

**Scout output format:** Scout prompts must structure output as constraint fields for the downstream execute prompt, not as instructions.

| Scout Output Section | Content | Maps to Execute Prompt |
|---------------------|---------|----------------------|
| `Confirmed scope` | Files/modules verified to exist; confirmed-existing method names and signatures (informational — not instructions) | `Scope:` field; HIGH tier method list |
| `Pattern references` | Existing code exemplifying required approach (file:path + brief note) | `Pattern references:` section |
| `Relevant ADR/KB refs` | Applicable decisions/standards; current ARCHITECTURE-BOGAME.md version | `References:` section |
| `Context / unexpected findings` | Anything differing from prompt assumptions | `Context:` section |
| `KB/ADR Assessment` | Per-ref from P{NN}-{name}.md: "Applicable (what to use)" / "Not applicable (reason)" / "Conflict (what differs)". Omit if no KB/ADR refs. | `KB/ADR Assessment (from Scout):` section in execute prompt (compact summary, not raw content) |
| `Broken References` | Files/paths referenced but not found at expected location. Per-ref: searched [paths], resolved to [actual path] / NOT FOUND ANYWHERE. If any NOT FOUND → **STOP and report to Claude Chat before continuing.** | Claude Chat escalates to Human. Never silently accept "missing" — exhaust L1 INDEX lookup + grep before reporting NOT FOUND. |

**Critical distinction for HIGH tier:** Scout may output method names and signatures as confirmed-existing information (e.g., "method `process_event(self, event: Event)` confirmed at `framework/events/processor.py`"). Scout must NOT frame these as instructions (e.g., "replace line 47 `process_event` with..."). The confirmed-existing list populates the HIGH-tier execute prompt's method specification; Claude Code uses it for pre-execution validation, not as a replacement script.

Scout output must NOT contain: line numbers, string replacement instructions, shell edit commands.

### Rule 3: One prompt = one decision-gate window
- Scout = one file with all read/search commands
- Execute = one file with all work between two review gates
- All cycles within one decision-gate window belong in one prompt,
  regardless of how many topics, modules, or cycles they span
- Split only when Claude Chat must review output before the next step runs
- Within a combined prompt, each cycle is a labeled section (§C260, §C261...)
  with its own acceptance criteria

### Rule 4: Environment from ENVIRONMENT.md
Before creating any prompt, Claude Chat reads **ENVIRONMENT.md** (path: docs/01_refer/ENVIRONMENT.md, referenced from S{N}-SPRINT.md) and injects concrete values: shell type, project path, tool versions. Shell Notes and Tool Notes in ENVIRONMENT.md contain project-specific pitfalls that must be checked before creating prompts.

Protocols are universal — they know nothing about the project. ENVIRONMENT.md is the bridge.

Protocol steps prefer WHAT over HOW: describe the goal, not the shell command. Claude Code selects appropriate tools based on ENVIRONMENT.md shell type. Example: "generate file tree from filesystem" not "run `tree` command"; "count test files" not "Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Include *.py". Exceptions: git commands (universal across environments) and explicit tool invocations in numbered Rules (e.g., Rule 7 database schema checks).

### Rule 5: When to debate, when not

| Situation | Tool |
|-----------|------|
| Need ADR with formal rationale | vector-debates skill in a separate chat. Result returns as .md file. No dedicated Session Code. |
| Need data from codebase | Scout |
| Need external information | Research (web search) |
| Simple question, resolved in a minute | Decision in chat |
| Need test verification in prompt | Add explicit pytest command with path |

Debates happen during 07_Brain-Next. If an architectural question arises mid-sprint, log it in BACKLOG-BOGAME.md and resolve it at the next 07_Brain-Next. Emergency exceptions require Human approval.

### Rule 6: Load protocol before executing

Before running any protocol, Claude Chat MUST:
1. Have the protocol .md file loaded in chat (request from Human if missing)
2. Read its "Before You Begin" checklist
3. Request ALL listed documents from Human before starting work
4. Output Session Plan

**Human confirmation of Session Plan required ONLY for:**
- 02_Sprint-Builder
- 06_Spec-Update

**All other protocols are deterministic** — output Session Plan, then execute immediately without waiting for confirmation. Real decisions happen at embedded STOP gates within the protocols, not at session plan level.

Before You Begin checklist in each protocol is the structural enforcement of this rule.

If a doc from "Before You Begin" is missing mid-session — STOP and request it.

**No embedded protocol steps:** Phase-Builder CLOSE steps must not be embedded in execute prompts. Always run 03_Phase-Builder CLOSE as a separate protocol pass. Embedding skips Session Review and violates protocol loading requirement.

### Rule 7: Database-aware prompts

When a cycle reads from or writes to any database:

**Scout prompts MUST include:**
- `sqlite3 <db_path> ".schema <table_name>"` for every target table
- Read actual content of migration SQL files (not assume from ADR)
- Cross-validate migration numbering (file vs ADR vs DB state)

**Test prompts MUST include:**
- DB fixture setup for ALL code paths that write to DB
- Check sad/error/escalation paths explicitly — not just happy path
- If any branch in the test calls a method that writes to DB → fixture required

Do not rely on Claude Code's retelling of Python code for schema. Read the real DB.

**None vs empty list:** When testing service methods that return collections (list_checkpoints, load_latest, etc.), explicitly check whether the method returns `None` or `[]` on "not found". Different handlers are required — `if result:` treats both as falsy but they mean different things.

### Rule 8: Chat language follows the user

Claude Chat auto-detects the user's language from their messages and communicates in the same language throughout the session. Protocol names, file paths, and technical terms stay in English — everything else follows user's language.

If the user switches language mid-session, Claude Chat follows the switch immediately.

### Rule 9: Dependent protocol loading

When a protocol requires context from other documents (e.g., 03_Phase-Builder last cycle of phase needs ARCHITECTURE-BOGAME.md for compliance check), Claude Chat MUST have all relevant context loaded before starting work. If dependent context is not available — STOP and request it from Human.

This prevents protocol execution from memory when a sub-task is triggered mid-session.

### Rule 10: Backlog Routing

Two backlogs exist with distinct scopes:

| Backlog | File | Marker | Scope | Consumers |
|---------|------|--------|-------|-----------|
| SPEC BACKLOG | docs/02_spec/01_refer/KNOWLEDGE/SPEC-BACKLOG.md | "SPEC BACKLOG" | Protocol/rule improvements, process fixes, SPEC version changes | 06_Spec-Update (SPEC Phase) |
| Project Backlog | docs/01_refer/KNOWLEDGE/BACKLOG-BOGAME.md | "Project Backlog" | Code issues, tech debt, features, integrations, UI/UX, Code-Review MEDIUM/LOW | 02_Sprint-Builder |

**Routing rules (always use qualified markers):**
- Code-Review MEDIUM/LOW (code issues) → Project Backlog
- Protocol or rule improvement ideas → SPEC BACKLOG
- Unsure → Project Backlog (default)

**Never mix:** framework process improvements in project backlog or project code bugs in framework backlog. Never use bare "backlog" — always qualify: "SPEC BACKLOG" or "Project Backlog".

### Rule 11: Prompt Self-Containment

Every prompt artifact created by Claude Chat for Claude Code must include:

**Before You Begin** — at the top of the prompt:

## Before You Begin
Read these files (use Get-Content or equivalent from Environment):
□ [file1]
□ [file2]


Claude Code reads files from the filesystem, not from uploaded attachments. The Before You Begin section must list every file the prompt depends on with its full path.

**Handoff** — at the end of the prompt:

## Handoff
Next protocol: [protocol name]
Load: S{N}-SPRINT.md + 01_Declaration.md + [next protocol file]


Every prompt must tell Claude Chat what comes next. No dead ends.

Exceptions: Scout prompts that are part of a multi-prompt cycle may omit the Handoff section (the Execute prompt that follows will have it).

### Rule 12: Pre-Execution Validation (tier-differentiated)

Every execute prompt must begin with a **Pre-Execution Validation** block at the very top. Validation depth depends on the prompt's Risk tier (see Rule 15).

| Tier | Pre-Execution Requirements |
|------|---------------------------|
| **HIGH** | (1) Enumerate all files to be modified by name. (2) Confirm each named method/path/signature exists and matches prompt specification. (3) Confirm acceptance criteria are runnable. (4) Stage: Gather → report findings → Validate → confirm all preconditions met → Apply. Stop on any validation failure; report before proceeding. |
| **MEDIUM** | (1) Enumerate all files to be modified from scope + scout output. If unable → stop and report, do not guess. (2) Verify referenced pattern files accessible and match expected shape. (3) Confirm acceptance criteria runnable. Then execute. |
| **LOW** | Proceed per goal. Run `Verify:` after execution. Report result. |

**Tier tag: `affects-global-state`**

Any execute prompt touching: registry, lifespan, middleware, ABC/interface changes, global singletons — must include tag `affects-global-state` in the prompt header.

Consequence: Acceptance Criteria MUST include full-suite regression:
- [ ] pytest → all pass (not scope-local, full suite)

Cycles qualifying: ServiceRegistry, lifespan events, ABC base classes, middleware stack, global config, shared fixtures, any import-time state.

Tag placement: add to prompt Artifact Header Schema after Risk field:
`Tag: affects-global-state` (if applicable)

Canonical case: P81 C364-FIX discovered test pollution class (40 failures not caught by scope-local acceptance). C367/C370/C375 were paranoid-tagged and ran full regression per Q9(c) judgment — this tier tag formalizes that discipline as a Rule 12 requirement, not a judgment call.

**Universal:** If scope + scout output do not establish which files will be modified → stop and report. Never guess scope.

**Scope distinction:** Pre-Execution Validation checks structural preconditions
(files exist, signatures match, acceptance criteria are runnable commands).
Behavioural verification (tests pass, no regressions, no TODO left) is handled by
03_Phase-Builder CLOSE Verification Scout — not by Pre-Exec.

**Visible Output Requirement (all tiers):**

Claude Code MUST output visible validation blocks — not silently validate.

Before starting work, output one line:

    Pre-Exec: ✓ [N files confirmed, preconditions met]

or if validation fails:

    Pre-Exec: ✗ [what failed] — STOPPING

After completing all work, output a checklist:

    Post-Exec:
    □ [acceptance criterion 1] — PASS/FAIL
    □ [acceptance criterion 2] — PASS/FAIL
    Result: [N/N passed]

These blocks are mandatory. They make validation visible to Human reviewing Claude Code output. Without them, validation happens silently and failures go unnoticed.

**Validation Gate:**
Claude Chat does NOT say "prompt is ready" until Pre-Execution Validation is complete.
Human does NOT send the prompt to Claude Code until Claude Chat confirms: "Validation: PASSED".

Consequence of violation: HIGH-severity bugs reach the codebase and are discovered
only at Phase-Builder CLOSE — too late to prevent them cleanly.

Claude Chat adds this block when creating execute prompts. Claude Code runs it before Step 0.

Exceptions: Scout prompts are read-only — Pre-Execution Validation is not required.

### Rule 13: SPEC Protocol Work Separation

SPEC protocols and Project code are separate product layers with separate lifecycles.

**SPEC Phase** runs between 04_Sprint-Closer and 02_Sprint-Builder — never inside
a project sprint. Exception: if a protocol is blocking project work (broken flow,
ambiguous instructions causing repeated failures), Human may authorize emergency
protocol fix mid-sprint. Log as emergency exception in Protocol Log.

| Layer | Contains | Lifecycle |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| Project | Code, features, tech debt, Code-Review items | Phases + Cycles inside a Sprint |
| SPEC | Protocol improvements, rule changes, version updates | 05_Clean-Sync + 06_Spec-Update + 07_Brain-Next between sprints |

**Context evolution (S12):** Protocol originally designed for 200K context window
(per-cycle overhead: scout/execute/verify/doc/commit per cycle = "Cycle-Builder" pattern).
Context window grew to 1M tokens — enabling phase-level batching: one combined scout,
all cycles execute sequentially, one commit at phase close. Protocol renamed from
Cycle-Builder to Phase-Builder to reflect this shift. Per-cycle overhead eliminated
in favor of per-phase overhead (OPEN → WORK → CLOSE).

**Rules:**
- SPEC items from SPEC BACKLOG are never included in project cycles or phases
- If a SPEC idea arises during project work — log it in SPEC BACKLOG, continue project work
- SPEC Phase has its own cycles, its own commits, its own review
- 04_Sprint-Closer closes the sprint; 05_Clean-Sync runs next; 06_Spec-Update follows; 07_Brain-Next runs; then 02_Sprint-Builder
- Emergency mid-sprint SPEC fix requires Human approval + Protocol Log entry + PATCH version bump in modified file header/anchor + SPEC-CHANGELOG entry

### Rule 14: Document Priority

When documents conflict, this priority applies:

S{N}-SPRINT.md > ADR > P{NN}-{name}.md > cycle doc

P{NN}-{name}.md is a tactical plan derived from S{N}-SPRINT and ADRs. If P{NN}-{name}.md conflicts with S{N}-SPRINT or an ADR — update P{NN}-{name}.md to match, not the other way around.

### Rule 15: Prompt Style Guide (Tiered)

All prompts for Claude Code (scout AND execute) follow universal principles. Execute prompts are additionally governed by their Risk tier.

#### Universal Principles (all tiers, no exceptions)

| # | Principle |
|---|-----------|
| U1 | **Scope + Anti-scope declaration required.** `Scope: [files/modules]` and `Anti-scope: [explicitly excluded]` in every prompt. |
| U2 | **No hardcoded runtime values.** Test counts, commit counts, LOC — never hardcode. Use `[ACTUAL_COUNT]` placeholder or instruct Claude Code to run the count command and report. |
| U3 | **Pre-write structure, not content.** Provide section headers and table formats. Let Claude Code fill from gathered data. |
| U4 | **Forward slashes in all paths.** Work everywhere; backslashes do not. |
| U5 | **Fallback decision trees.** "If X fails → do Y, else → report N/A." State decision logic, not extraction code. |
| U6 | **One deliverable per decision-gate window.** When multiple cycles merge into one prompt (Rule 16), each cycle section has its own acceptance criteria. The prompt has one aggregate Completion Signal at the end. |
| U7 | **No shell edit scripts in prompts.** Never include `.Replace()`, `sed`, `awk`, or any string-manipulation commands as prompt instructions — they fail silently on unicode dashes, non-breaking spaces, and encoding differences. Also drop: `Set-Location`, `-Encoding` flags, post-edit verification scripts. Claude Code chooses its own tools. All file content referenced in execute prompts must be either embedded inline or exist at a known repo path. Never reference "attachments" — Claude Code has no attachment mechanism. |
| U8 | **Scope lock.** At the end of every execute prompt: "Mark DONE: Steps X, Y, Z. Steps N–M remain TODO." Claude Code updates ONLY listed steps. No forward-marking. |
| U9 | **State intent alongside instructions.** So Claude Code can adapt when reality differs from the prompt. |
| U10 | **Rule 17 compliance.** Prompts that involve code changes must reference the relevant section of ARCHITECTURE-BOGAME.md coding standards. For MEDIUM tier, include the ARCHITECTURE-BOGAME.md version in the `References:` section (e.g., `ARCHITECTURE-BOGAME.md v2.3 §4 — Coding Standards`). |

#### Tier Table

| Tier | Assign if ANY is true | Required Prompt Elements |

| **HIGH** | Touches auth/security boundary · Is a data migration · Changes a public API or breaking interface · Cross-service schema change | Exact file paths · Confirmed method names + expected signatures (sourced from scout `Confirmed scope`) · Staged execution: Gather → Validate → Apply · Acceptance Criteria (runnable commands) |
| **MEDIUM** | New feature · Refactor · Test addition · Module-level change · Any code change not HIGH | Intent statement · Pattern references (file:path exemplar) · ADR/KB + ARCHITECTURE-BOGAME.md version citation (U10) · Acceptance Criteria (runnable commands) · NO exact line numbers or string replacements |
| **LOW** | Documentation only · Config/formatting · Changelog/version bump | Goal statement · Done signal · `Verify:` field (one-liner, runnable) |

> **Default rule:** If tier is uncertain, assign MEDIUM. Never default to LOW for code changes.

#### Prompt Artifact Header Schema (required — all execute prompts)


# [Prompt Title]
Type: execute
Risk: HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW
Scope: [file paths or module names]
Anti-scope: [explicitly excluded]
Phase/Step: [e.g. Phase-03 / Step 4]


#### MEDIUM Tier Prompt Body (required structure)

markdown
## Intent
[What to achieve — not how]

## Pattern References
- [file:path] — [one-line note on which pattern to follow]

## References
- ARCHITECTURE-BOGAME.md v[X.Y] §[section] — [relevant standard]
- ADR-[NNN]: [title] (if applicable)
- KB-[ref] (if applicable)

## Context
[Scout findings that differ from expectations, if any]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] [command] → [expected result]
- [ ] [command] → [expected result]


#### Acceptance Criteria Format (HIGH and MEDIUM)


## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] [command] → [expected result]
- [ ] [command] → [expected result]


Examples: `pytest -k test_auth → all pass` · `grep -r 'bare except' src/ → 0 results`

#### Verify Field Format (LOW only)


Verify: [one runnable command] → [expected result]


Example: `Verify: grep '\[placeholder\]' docs/01_refer/ARCHITECTURE-BOGAME.md → 0 results`

#### Test-Writing Prompts — Required Acceptance Criteria

Every execute prompt that writes or modifies tests must include a test-count acceptance criterion:


## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] pytest -k [scope] → all pass
- [ ] pytest --co -q [scope] → [ACTUAL_COUNT] tests collected


`[ACTUAL_COUNT]` is not hardcoded at prompt-authoring time. Claude Code runs the count command and reports the actual number.

### Rule 16: Prompt Splitting

The test: Is there a decision gate between the prompts?

A decision gate is a point where Claude Chat (or Human) MUST review the output
and make a go/no-go decision before the next prompt runs.
If no one reviews between prompt A and prompt B — they are one prompt.

SPLIT when:
- There is a STOP + review gate (Scout → Claude Chat validates → Execute)
- Claude Chat needs the output of prompt N to build prompt N+1
- Human must approve a result or choose an option before continuing
- Different Claude Code sessions

KEEP in one prompt when:
- Human will send both to Claude Code without stopping
- No Claude Chat validation between them
- Pre-Execution Validation of subsequent steps already covers error detection
- Steps are sequential and Claude Code determines success/failure itself

Practical test before creating prompts:
  Will Claude Chat review the output of prompt N before Human sends prompt N+1?
  YES → split (real gate exists)
  NO  → merge into one prompt

What counts as a decision gate:
- Claude Chat validates scout findings against loaded documents
- Claude Chat confirms an architectural decision before code changes
- Human reviews test results and approves the next step
- Claude Chat builds the next prompt based on output of the previous

What does NOT count as a decision gate:
- Pre-Execution Validation inside a prompt (self-check, not external gate)
- "Different risk areas" without intermediate review
- Topic/module separation when all steps run sequentially
- Separate commits (one prompt can contain multiple commits)

Default: one execute prompt per cycle. Splitting only when the test above → YES.

**Batch Prompt Delivery:** When Combined Scout covers all cycles and no decision
gate exists between cycles, Claude Chat creates ONE combined execute prompt
covering all cycles as sequential sections (§C260, §C261...). Each section
retains its own Pre-Execution Validation and Acceptance Criteria. Claude Code
executes sections in order, stops on first failure. One file = one copy-paste.
See 03_Phase-Builder § Batch Prompt Delivery for full rules.

Size exception: If a prompt exceeds Claude Code's effective context window
(output quality degrades) — split at a logical block boundary.

### Rule 17: Coding Standards

Every project MUST have a Coding Standards section in ARCHITECTURE-BOGAME.md (or a separate CODING-STANDARDS.md).

This section defines:
- Naming conventions (variables, functions, classes, files, folders)
- Error handling pattern (what to catch, how to log, how to propagate)
- Logging format and levels
- Import order and grouping
- API response format (if applicable)
- Test naming and structure conventions

Coding Standards are created during Spec-Install or 02_Sprint-Builder (Step 2).
Claude Code prompts reference this section when generating new code.
03_Phase-Builder OPEN Combined Scout checks new code against these standards.
03_Phase-Builder CLOSE Verification Scout validates compliance.
04_Sprint-Closer Part 1 verifies cross-module consistency against these standards.

### Rule 18: Knowledge Consumption Chain

KB and ADR content enters execution through a defined chain — not ad-hoc loading.

| Level | Content | Consumed at | Loaded by |
|-------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| L0 | KNOWLEDGE-BOGAME.md (combined KB + ADR) | 07_Brain-Next, 02_Sprint-Builder | Before You Begin |
| L1 | Domain indexes ({DOMAIN}-INDEX.md) | 02_Sprint-Builder | Only domains referenced in ROADMAP-BOGAME.md for this sprint |
| L2 | Topic files, ADR files | 03_Phase-Builder OPEN | Via scout prompt — refs from P{NN}-{name}.md |

Rules:
- L2 content enters cycle via file read in scout prompt — not via execute prompt
- Scout produces compact KB/ADR Assessment; execute receives assessment, not raw content
- Claude Chat logs per-ref include/skip decision in cycle doc (no Human approval gate)
- When no KB/ADR refs exist in P{NN}-{name}.md → skip gracefully, no empty mandatory sections
- **ADR/KB filename resolution:** ADR-NNN references in P{NN}-{name}.md are numbers, not filenames.
  Brain-Next renames ADR files to topic-based names (e.g., ADR-023 → multi-llm-provider-architecture.md).
  Resolution chain: ADR-NNN → L1 INDEX (BOGAME-ADR-INDEX.md) → File column → actual L2 filename.
  KB refs use relative paths (e.g., KB-ENGINEERING/agent-memory.md) → prepend docs/01_refer/KNOWLEDGE/.
  Scout prompts MUST resolve ADR numbers to filenames via L1 INDEX before attempting to read L2 files.

### Rule 19: Information Map

ENVIRONMENT.md must contain an Information Map section defining file boundaries:
- What each document Contains and Does NOT Contain
- No Producer/Consumer columns (tracked in Information-Flow-Matrix.md — not duplicated)
- Base template covers universal SPEC files; project adds specific files during setup

Information Map is created during Spec-Install and validated during 04_Sprint-Closer.

### Rule 20: File Loading Discipline

Claude Chat reads ONLY files explicitly provided in the current session:
- Files listed in the `<uploaded_files>` block of Human's message
- Files whose content appears in `<documents>` blocks

**Never** access /mnt/user-data/uploads/ autonomously for files not listed above.
Leftover files from previous sessions are stale and potentially outdated.

**Session start requirement:** Before any work, Claude Chat explicitly lists all
loaded files by name. Human sees what Claude Chat has and hasn't loaded.
If a required file from Before You Begin is missing — STOP and request it.

### Rule 21: Document Write Boundary

Every document has a declared set of protocols that may write to it (see SSOT Write Map
in `docs/02_spec/01_refer/GOVERNANCE/Information-Flow-Matrix.md`).

If a protocol is NOT listed in the "Updated by" column for a given file —
it MUST NOT write to that file.

The Write Map is SSOT for write access.
Exception: 06_Spec-Update may update any Tier 1 file (framework health fix).

### Rule 22: Validation Anti-Bias

When validating own output or Claude Code results:

**ATTENTION: You are validating your own output. You are biased toward
confirming it is correct. Compensate: assume problems exist and hunt for them.**

**LOGIC checklist (apply ALL 6 classes):**

| Class | What it catches |
|-------|----------------|
| **COMPLETENESS** | Everything declared is present; nothing promised is missing |
| **CONSISTENCY** | Zero contradictions within the material and against context |
| **NAMING** | Name matches actual content; misleading names cause downstream errors |
| **SESSION CONSISTENCY** | Earlier decisions faithfully represented — did we decide X but write Y? |
| **CASCADE** | Every change traced to all downstream references |
| **NEGATIVE** | Everything removed is gone everywhere — no ghost references |

**Inline definition for execute prompts:**
> LOGIC = {COMPLETENESS, CONSISTENCY, NAMING, SESSION CONSISTENCY}
> CASCADE = side effects traced downstream
> NEGATIVE = ghost references eliminated after removal

**Severity:** BREAK (blocks downstream) > GAP (missing, not blocking) > NIT (cosmetic).
Do not downgrade severity to make results look cleaner.

**Spot-check mandatory:** numbers, versions, dates, counts, cross-references —
highest error rate, verify each explicitly.

**Standard inline line for execute prompts:**

    Validate: LOGIC + CASCADE + NEGATIVE

Add this line at the end of every execute prompt. Claude Code runs all 6 classes before marking step DONE.

### Rule 23: Stream Scope Lock

When a phase has multiple entries (parallel streams), scope partitioning is
enforced at planning time (02_Sprint-Builder Step 5) — not at runtime.

**Rules:**
- Each entry owns a declared set of files/modules. Overlap = planning violation.
- 02_Sprint-Builder Step 5 includes an overlap check before phase is approved.
- During execution, a cycle's scout and execute prompts operate ONLY within its
  entry's declared scope. Touching files outside the entry scope = Rule 23 violation.
- If a task requires files from multiple entries → it belongs in a sequential phase
  or must be restructured to eliminate the overlap.
- Scope lock is visible in P{NN}-{name}.md → Streams table.

### Rule 24: Completion Signal

Every execute prompt sent to Claude Code MUST end with a Completion Signal instruction.
Claude Code outputs this signal as the LAST thing after finishing all work.

**Format:**
```
✅ P{NN} Step {XX}: {step name} — DONE
Tests: {pass count} passed | Files changed: {count}
```

**Failed format:**
```
❌ P{NN} Step {XX}: {step name} — FAILED
Reason: {one line}
```

**Rules:**
- Signal is the LAST output line — nothing after it
- Step number matches the phase chat plan from Session Plan
- If tests were not part of this step: `Tests: N/A`
- If Claude Code is unsure whether the task succeeded: use ❌ and explain

**Claude Chat adds this to every execute prompt:**
```
## Completion Signal
When done, output:
✅ P{NN} Step {XX}: {step name} — DONE
Tests: [count] passed | Files changed: [count]
If failed:
❌ P{NN} Step {XX}: {step name} — FAILED
Reason: [one line]
```

This signal is the primary feedback mechanism. Without it, Human cannot
distinguish "Claude Code finished" from "Claude Code is still thinking"
or "Claude Code silently failed."

### Rule 25: Pre-Draft Checklist

Before creating any execute prompt, Claude Chat verifies:

□ **Shell syntax** — every command checked against ENVIRONMENT.md Shell Notes.
  PowerShell: no bash patterns (2>/dev/null, ls, grep without Select-String alternative).
  Use correct quoting, Get-ChildItem patterns, -Recurse with -Include.
□ **CASCADE** — for every file modified, check: does any other document
  reference this file's content (version, count, path)? If yes → include update.
□ **Scope verification** — all files in Scope confirmed to exist (via scout or context).
  No assumed paths. Anti-scope explicitly listed.
□ **KB/ADR path resolution** — ADR refs from P{NN}-{name}.md resolved to actual L2 filenames
  via L1 INDEX (BOGAME-ADR-INDEX.md / {DOMAIN}-INDEX.md). No assumed filenames.
  KB relative paths (KB-DOMAIN/file.md) verified with full repo path prefix.
□ **Before You Begin** — includes every file the prompt reads OR writes.
□ **No hardcoded values** — counts, versions, test numbers use [ACTUAL] placeholders
  with commands to determine real values (Rule U2).
□ **NEGATIVE check** — if removing/renaming anything, verify no ghost references
  remain in downstream docs.
□ **Design Review completed** — Phase-Builder OPEN Design Review ran before first execute prompt.
  Quick or Full mode per conditions. No unresolved STOP items. Output recorded inline in chat.

Checklist is silent — Claude Chat runs it internally, does not output it.
If any check fails → fix the prompt before presenting. Do not present and re-fix.

### Versioning Rules

**Canonical-source rule (Tier 1 — protocol files):** In all protocol files, the header is the authoritative version source. The anchor block footer is a display copy and must always equal the header value. Mismatch is blocking in 06_Spec-Update.

Tier 1 format:
- Header: `> SPEC vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH | [one-liner purpose]`
- Anchor: `[Short name] SPEC vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

**Tier Registry:** Full document-to-tier version mapping is published in Spec-Install.md. See that file for tier assignments. Summary:
- Tier 1 (SPEC version, shared): all protocol files + framework reference files in `docs/02_spec/01_refer/`
- Tier 2 (individual version + changelog): ARCHITECTURE-BOGAME.md, VISION-BOGAME.md
- Tier 3 (date-stamp only): ENVIRONMENT.md, ROADMAP-BOGAME.md, FILE-TREE-BOGAME.md
- Tier 4 (no versioning): sprint/phase/cycle docs, ADRs, KB artifacts

### Changelog Rule

**Tier 2 documents** (ARCHITECTURE-BOGAME.md, VISION-BOGAME.md): when updated — add a row to its Changelog section:


| [version+0.1] | [date] | S{N}: [name] or C{NN}: [name] | [one line: what changed] |


If no changes — do not touch Changelog. Version bump + changelog row is a numbered deliverable in every execute prompt that modifies a Tier 2 document.

**Tier 1 documents** (protocol files): changelog is centralized in `docs/02_spec/01_refer/GOVERNANCE/SPEC-CHANGELOG.md`. Individual protocol files do not have inline changelogs.

This rule applies in every protocol that updates Tier 2 documents:
- 02_Sprint-Builder (Steps 1-2)
- 03_Phase-Builder last cycle of phase (architecture check)
- 03_Phase-Builder CLOSE (Step 4c)
- 05_Clean-Sync (Step 4)

---

## Session Structure

### Session Plan (start of every chat)
After loading S{N}-SPRINT.md, Claude Chat outputs a session plan before doing anything:


## Session Plan
| # | Step | Protocol | Est. |
|---|------|----------|------|
| 1 | ... | ... | ... |      ← Est. is optional
| N | Update S{N}-SPRINT.md + commit | — | 5 min |


**Human confirmation required ONLY for:** 02_Sprint-Builder, 06_Spec-Update (see Rule 6).
All other protocols: Session Plan is output, then execution begins immediately — no confirmation wait.
Real decisions happen at embedded STOP gates within the protocols, not at session plan level.

Last step is always: Protocol Log updated + commit + S{N}-SPRINT.md updated + For Human written.

### For Human Template (mandatory in every protocol close)

Every protocol close must include a For Human block using this format:

```
## For Human
> Next chat instruction. Copy-paste.

**Session Code:** S{N}-[Protocol-Name]
**Load:**
1. Framework: 01_Declaration.md + [next protocol].md
2. Project: ENVIRONMENT.md + [other project docs as needed]
3. Sprint: S{N}-SPRINT.md + P{NN}-{name}.md [if applicable]
**Run:** [protocol name] — [first step]
```

Grouping order is always: (1) Framework files, (2) Project files, (3) Sprint files.
This template cannot be omitted. If For Human is missing at close — protocol is not complete.

### Running SPEC Log (per session)

> SPEC-LOG = per-session inline findings captured during work.
> Persisted to SPEC BACKLOG (file) at session close. Not the same thing.

Claude Chat maintains a running list of SPEC observations inline in chat as work progresses:
  SPEC-LOG: [brief description] — [step where found]

At Session Review (03_Phase-Builder CLOSE), the list is transferred to SPEC BACKLOG.
Purpose: findings are captured when discovered, not reconstructed from memory at session end.

### SPEC Finding Standard

Every SPEC finding logged to SPEC BACKLOG must include:

Minimum inline format:
  Problem:    [one sentence — what happens in practice]
  Root Cause: [one sentence — why it happens]
  Fix:        [concrete action + file]

Full format (separate .md file) — for Rule-level changes or findings requiring examples:
  - Problem (with example from a specific cycle)
  - Root Cause
  - Proposed Solution
  - Examples: before (wrong) / after (correct)
  - Impact: what improves after the change

Signal: If a finding cannot be described abstractly without mentioning a specific
project — it is NOT a SPEC finding. Route to Project Backlog instead.

### Universal Close Flow (every protocol that closes a chat)

Before closing any chat, execute these steps in order:

1. Verify all planned steps are DONE
2. Scan chat for unrecorded decisions/findings — SPEC-LOG items?
3. If SPEC-LOG items found → create execute prompt to persist them to `docs/02_spec/01_refer/KNOWLEDGE/SPEC-BACKLOG.md`. Wait for Claude Code confirmation. If no items → record "SPEC-LOG: nothing to persist"
4. Check for deferred items: scan chat for any "do later", "next chat", "handle next time" verbal commitments. If found → write each item to Project Backlog or SPEC BACKLOG immediately via execute prompt. Verbal intent in chat without a written record does not exist. Never close a chat with unrecorded deferred items.
5. Update S{N}-SPRINT.md: Current State, Protocol Log, Last Session, Next Action, For Human.
   **Exception:** 06_Spec-Update — S{N}-SPRINT.md may not exist between sprints. If absent → skip, record in ENVIRONMENT.md only.
6. Final commit + push
7. Output: current Session Code + next Session Code + what to load
8. STOP — close chat

**SPEC-LOG items MUST be persisted via execute prompt BEFORE closing chat. Listing in chat is NOT persisting.**

### Session Validation (before closing chat)

**Documents**
□ All planned steps are DONE
□ S{N}-SPRINT.md updated: Current State, Protocol Log, Last Session, Next Action, For Human
□ Commit made and pushed
□ For Human section contains clear instruction for next chat

**Chat Review** (scroll through this chat)
□ Every decision made in this chat is recorded in a document
  (cycle doc Result, ARCHITECTURE-BOGAME.md, ADR, or S{N}-SPRINT.md — not left in chat only)
□ Every deviation from protocol is recorded
  (skipped step → reason in Protocol Log; changed approach → reason in cycle doc)
□ Unfinished tasks routed to SPEC BACKLOG or Project Backlog (Rule 10)
□ Running SPEC Log reviewed — all items persisted to SPEC BACKLOG via execute prompt (not just listed in chat)
□ No "do later" / "next chat" / "handle next time" items left as verbal-only — all written to Backlog

**Handoff**
□ For Human describes the next chat — does NOT request files for next protocol in this chat
□ Next protocol file is NOT loaded in this chat
□ If last working cycle of phase: Next Action = phase closed, next phase or 04_Sprint-Closer

Always run, even when "everything is obviously done".

## Recovery Patterns

| Situation | Action |
|---|---|
| Claude Code returned an error | STOP. Report to Human. Do not attempt to fix without understanding the cause. |
| Context overflow before Phase-Builder CLOSE | Run CLOSE immediately with what exists. Unfinished steps → Project Backlog. |
| Chat closed accidentally mid-cycle | Open new chat. Load S{N}-SPRINT.md → Next Action. Resume from last DONE step. |
| Git conflict on push | STOP. Report to Human. Do not resolve automatically. |
| S{N}-SPRINT.md missing | Use Spec-Install.md → reconstruct from project history. |
| P{NN}-{name}.md not found | STOP. Check 02_Sprint-Builder — likely incomplete. Run it. |
| File referenced but not found | STOP. Search L1 INDEX for filename mapping. grep repo for content. If found at different path → fix reference, continue. If NOT FOUND anywhere → escalate to Human with: expected path, search methods tried, result. Never write "missing" to backlog without exhaustive search. |
| Recovery fails after 2 attempts | STOP. Do not attempt further fixes. Report to Human with: current S{N}-SPRINT.md → Current State, last 3 lines of git log, exact error message. Human decides next action. |

---

## Prompt Validation Checklist

Before sending any prompt to Claude Code:


□ File paths exist and are correct (verify against FILE-TREE-BOGAME.md when available)
□ Shell syntax — cross-check each command against ENVIRONMENT.md § Shell Notes pitfalls (do not assume bash or PowerShell)
□ Class/model references match actual code
□ No abstract "add/update" — only exact values
□ Git push included
□ Existing files — warning before overwrite
□ Cross-validation: prompt vs documents loaded in chat
□ Scout searched all callers of modified methods via grep/glob (not memory)
□ When modifying CLI validators — full current decorator/validator shown, exact replacement given
□ When adding auth/middleware to endpoints — all existing tests for affected routes found and listed. Execute prompt updates them.
□ Coverage gaps: scout flagged modules with 0% test coverage as risk areas
□ All file references in prompt resolve inside the repo — no references to outputs/, uploads/, or chat-only artifacts
□ Risk tier assigned (HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW) and header fields present
□ Rule 16 — decision gate between prompts? If NO → merge into one prompt
□ Type/driver errors — scout must sweep entire layer using same driver, not just stacktrace file
□ KB/ADR refs from P{NN}-{name}.md included in scout prompt (Rule 18) — or graceful skip if none

## Quick Reference

Condensed operational habits from production experience. Not rules — reminders.

**Process**
- Scout ALWAYS = one prompt with all commands. Never split.
- Scout → Validate → Execute — order is sacred.
- Batch Prompt Delivery: after Combined Scout, ONE combined execute prompt covers all cycles as sequential sections (see Rule 16 + Phase-Builder § Batch Prompt Delivery).
- Agree on decision → then create prompt. Not the other way around.
- Verification cycle after fixes is critical.
- Discussions → into documents BEFORE closing session.
- Formal validation ≠ checkboxes. Actually verify each item.
- Running SPEC Log during session — capture findings when they happen, not at session end.
- SPEC-LOG persist via execute prompt — listing in chat is NOT persisting.
- Uncertain about codebase fact? → scout prompt. Never guess.
- Type/driver error in CI? → sweep all files using that driver. One stacktrace ≠ one file.

**Prompt Quality**
- Claude Chat MUST validate prompts before sending. Human should not find issues.
- File paths — verify existence before creating prompt.
- String replacements — exact string, won't break adjacent code.
- External markers like `"api"` — too broad, use specific markers.
- Scope lock: execute prompts explicitly list which steps change to DONE. No forward-marking.
- Risk tier: when in doubt → MEDIUM. Never default to LOW for code changes.
- Acceptance criteria: runnable commands with expected results. Not "tests pass" — which tests, which command.

**Framework**
- Protocol-First: load protocol BEFORE executing. Never from memory.
- One protocol = one chat. No exceptions. Close chat after protocol completes.
- Global cycle numbering across entire project — check last number in S{N}-SPRINT.md before Phase-Builder OPEN.
- ROADMAP-BOGAME.md + S{N}-SPRINT.md: strategic ROADMAP-BOGAME.md updated at sprint close only. S{N}-SPRINT.md is live state.
- Shell/tool-specific pitfalls belong in ENVIRONMENT.md, not in universal Rules.
- Rule 13: SPEC protocol work never mixes into project cycles. Emergency mid-sprint fix requires Human approval.
- Rule 18: KB/ADR enters execution via L0→L1→L2 chain. Scout loads, execute receives assessment.
- NOT FRAMEWORK test: if a finding cannot be described without mentioning a specific project — route to Project Backlog.
- Session Code in Protocol Log: use full code (S2-P03-E1-C12), not bare cycle number or dash.
- ENVIRONMENT.md gate: always load first, check SPEC Update before anything else.
- **Structural rename rule:** When renaming any section heading or protocol-wide term (e.g., Part 1→OPEN, Cycle-Builder→Phase-Builder): in the same commit, grep all protocol files for the old term and update every reference. Command: `grep -rn "OLD_TERM" docs/02_spec/ --include="*.md"`. Zero remaining hits required before commit. Canonical case: PART 1/PART 2 → OPEN/WORK/CLOSE rename (S12) left 15 dead references across Sprint-Builder, Spec-Update, Spec-Install — this rule would have caught them at commit time.
