"""VELO -- the `telegram_id` band registry, as DATA (T-58).

This module replaces `docs/telegram-id-bands.md`, which was deleted with
this delivery. A document could only be kept true by remembering to edit
it, and it stopped being true: it knew eight holders where the tree has
thirty, and it carried two comms bands that turned out to be invented.
What follows is read from the tree on every run instead.

WHY BANDS EXIST AT ALL
----------------------
The suite runs against a real Postgres, not a fresh one per file. Test
users are told apart by `telegram_id`, and each file cleans up after
itself by RANGE -- so a band is a file's private stretch of the number
line, and two files sharing a stretch share a fate.

WHY AN OVERLAP IS A HAZARD AND NOT AN UNTIDINESS
------------------------------------------------
`full_cleanup_range` (and every hand-rolled `_do_cleanup` copying it)
SELECTS EVERY USER IN THE RANGE, deletes the rows hanging off them --
bookings, feedbacks, checkins, master profiles -- and COMMITS. Many of
them delete the users too (`delete_users=True`). It runs around every
test, not once per file.

So an overlap does not clash on a unique key and fail loudly. It
DESTROYS THE OTHER FILE'S FIXTURES MID-RUN and the other file fails
somewhere else entirely, on an assertion that has nothing to do with
ids. That is why this is worth machinery.

TODAY NOTHING BREAKS, AND THAT IS A PROPERTY OF THE RUNNER, NOT OF THE
CODE: there is no `pytest-xdist`, no `addopts`, no CI at all (`.github/`
is empty), so files run one after another and each merely sweeps the
previous one's leftovers on entry. The day anything runs in parallel, or
two runs share the stand, every overlap below fires at once.

THE PRECEDENT WORTH KNOWING
---------------------------
`test_chats_t3_students.py` was moved off `89760-89799` because that
range was reserved -- a relocation that nothing verified, and three days
later another amendment claimed inside the destination. Moving a band is
not a fix unless the destination was checked. That is what this module
is for.

READ DECLARATIONS, NOT USAGES. Ids are frequently COMPUTED
(`BAND_MIN + 15`), so grepping for a literal `8981[0-9]` returns a
comment and reads clean while the collision is real. Worse, grepping for
the DECLARATION also lies: a band written in a comment -- a file
describing its NEIGHBOUR's range -- matches the same pattern. Every
reader below therefore parses the AST and looks only at module-level
assignments.

# T-58 fixed three named points and deliberately left the rest: rewriting
# bands across dozens of files in a repository with no CI, for a risk
# that does not fire today, is a worse trade than making the risk
# visible. This list is that visibility.
#
# `live` means the two files use THE SAME ACTUAL NUMBERS, listed in
# `shared`. `nominal` means only the declared ranges overlap while the
# numbers in use are disjoint. The distinction is computed from ids
# found in the files, WITH THE BAND-DECLARATION LITERALS EXCLUDED --
# `93000` and `93999` are a _TID_MIN/_TID_MAX pair, not ids, and
# counting them is how a live pair gets mislabelled nominal. That
# mistake was made twice while this task was being written.
#
# THE "ONLY SHRINKS" RULE IS A CONVENTION, NOT A GUARANTEE. One run
# cannot see the previous one, so nothing here stops a future entry from
# being appended. What protects it is that every line needs a
# justification in the diff, and the list is short enough to read. What
# IS machine-checked is the other half: an entry that no longer
# corresponds to a real overlap makes the check fail, so this list

# reader can see: they pass literals straight to the cleanup call, or
# they clean up nothing at all. For them the check has nothing to

#
# This is a frozen snapshot so the gap has a ratchet: a NEW file with no
# declaration fails the check and has to either declare a band or be
# added here on purpose. Each entry is also a re-derivable FACT -- the
# range, its width and whether it deletes user rows -- read from the
# cleanup call, so if a file changes what it sweeps and this record
# stays behind, the check says so.
#
# WIDTH AND DESTRUCTIVENESS TRIAGE WITHOUT ANY JUDGEMENT CALL. A file
# sweeping a thousand numbers is not the same as one sweeping twenty,
# and at equal width `delete_users=True` is not the same as False. We
# deliberately do NOT compare the swept range against the file's own
# usage: "own usage" has nine spellings in this tree, was miscounted
# twice in one day, and a wrong label is worse than no label -- it would
# lower the priority of a dangerous file and send the next person past
# it with a clear conscience.
#
# A record of `None` means the file creates users and cleans up NOTHING.
# Its rows survive the run -- unless a neighbour's range happens to
# cover them, which is a hygiene that depends on somebody else's file
# and says so nowhere.

    #      generated and interpolated in nine different spellings, and
    #      two attempts to count them by hand were wrong on the same
    #      day.
    #   2. Status: acknowledged by design.
    #   3. Backlog ref: none -- the strong form is described in item 5
    #      below rather than deferred to a ticket nobody will find.
    #   4. Promotion trigger: `pytest-xdist` appears in the dependencies,
    #      OR two runs share one stand. Either ends the property that
    #      makes today's overlaps harmless -- serial execution -- and at
    #      that moment every pair in KNOWN_OVERLAPS fires at once.
    #   5. Agreed fix: the registry becomes the ALLOCATOR. Files ask it
    #      for their numbers, a bare five-digit literal next to
    #      `telegram_id=` becomes a check failure, and collisions stop
    #      being possible by construction rather than by inspection.
    #      Cost: migrating some sixty files in a repository with no CI,
    #      which is why it waits for the trigger.
    #   6. Rejected: doing the strong form now. Sixty files of churn,
    #      verified only by one person running the suite by hand, to
    #      prevent something that cannot happen while the runner stays
    #      serial. Also rejected: labelling blind-zone files by
    #      comparing swept range against usage -- see BLIND_ZONE for
    #      why a computed label there would be worse than none.

# comms coordination -- deliberately absent
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This module holds NO copy of the comms repository's bands, and that is
# a decision rather than an omission.
#
# # KNOWN CEILING (no cross-repo band coordination; acknowledged by
# # design):
# #   1. Mechanics: velo and comms both create rows keyed by ids that
# #      look alike, but comms upserts its `Recipient` by the PRODUCT's
# #      UUID -- it has no uniqueness on `telegram_id` and no lookup by
# #      it. A number used on both sides collides with nothing and
# #      misaddresses nothing. There is therefore nothing to coordinate.
# #   2. Status: acknowledged by design.
# #   3. Backlog ref: none.
# #   4. Promotion trigger: comms grows a uniqueness constraint on
# #      `telegram_id`, or starts looking rows up by it. Either turns a
# #      shared number into a real collision.
# #   5. Agreed fix, at that point: allocate the two repositories
# #      disjoint spaces and check them from ONE place that can read
# #      both trees -- not by copying one into the other.
# #   6. Rejected: keeping a copy of comms' bands here. The registry
# #      this replaces did exactly that and half of it was fiction: it
# #      credited comms with 90000-90999 and 91000-91999, while a full
# #      numeric sweep of that tree finds six numbers, all in 92xxx.
# #      A copy of someone else's ranges drifts silently and we did not
# #      notice for nine days.
# #
# # AND WHEN THE TRIGGER FIRES, THE DATA IS ALREADY DIRTY: velo's suite
# # runs against a live stand whose relay ships `user_upserted` into
# # comms, so phantom recipients carrying velo test numbers are sitting
# # in the comms database right now. Whoever acts on this marker has to
# # clean rows, not just rules.
