# VELO Backend — Test Fixtures

#
# Solves three problems that broke tests before:
#   1. Event loop — single loop for all tests (no "Future attached to different loop")
#   2. Lifespan — init_redis() and engine are ready before tests run
#   3. Migrations — tables exist before tests run (alembic upgrade head)
#
# 7.1 fix: db_session rolls back before closing.
#   If a test crashes mid-operation and leaves uncommitted state in the
#   session (e.g. flushed but not committed), the rollback ensures that
#   state is discarded and does not bleed into the next test.
#   Tests that need data to persist use explicit session.commit() calls,
#   which are unaffected by the rollback (only uncommitted state is cleared).
#
# WARNING-4 / CRITICAL-4 fix: flush_auth_redis_keys runs before every test.
#   check_init_data_replay() writes init_data_used:{hash} with TTL=300s.
#   check_auth_rate_limit() writes auth_rate:{telegram_id} with TTL=60s.
#   Tests that call login_user() share telegram_ids and would collide:
#   the second login within the TTL window gets 400 "already used".
#   Deleting those key prefixes before each test prevents the cascade.
