# =============================================================================
# VELO Backend -- Telegram link host normalization (2026-07-14)
# =============================================================================
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS:
#   On 2026-07-13 the t.me domain stopped resolving worldwide: the .me registry
#   (Montenegro) pulled its delegation, so it is NXDOMAIN -- not a regional
#   block, not a firewall. Everything pointing at t.me died at once:
#     - notification deep links + master invite links (built from TELEGRAM_BOT_URL)
#     - every user avatar (Telegram hands us photo_url as
#       "https://t.me/i/userpic/320/<hash>.svg" inside initData)
#
#   Telegram serves the SAME content under several equivalent hosts -- see
#   https://core.telegram.org/api/links, which states that t.me may also be
#   telegram.me or telegram.dog. So the fix is a HOST SWAP: path and query are
#   already correct and stay untouched.
#
# THE POINT OF THIS MODULE:
#   It is the ONE place in the backend that knows which host is currently
#   alive. Both config (TELEGRAM_BOT_URL, normalized once at startup in
#   config.py) and data (photo_url, normalized on every login in
#   auth/service.py) flow through normalize_telegram_url().
#
#   When the next host dies: change settings.telegram_link_domain
#   (env TELEGRAM_LINK_DOMAIN) -- and nothing else in the codebase.
# =============================================================================

# Hosts Telegram treats as aliases of one another. Any of them can reach us
# either from .env (hand-written) or from Telegram itself (initData photo_url),
# so all of them are candidates for rewriting.
#
# t.me         -- dead since 2026-07-13 (registry-level, worldwide)
# telegram.me  -- alive, current default (verified: serves /i/userpic/, 200)
# telegram.dog -- alive, in a different TLD than .me -- the escape hatch if the
#                 Montenegrin registry ever takes telegram.me down as well

def normalize_telegram_url(url: str | None, live_host: str) -> str | None:
    """Rewrite a Telegram link/avatar URL onto the host that is currently alive.

    Only known Telegram alias hosts are rewritten. Anything else -- a custom
    avatar URL, an empty string, None -- passes through untouched, so this is
    safe to apply blindly to any URL that may or may not come from Telegram.

    Args:
        url: URL to normalize, e.g. "https://t.me/i/userpic/320/abc.svg".
        live_host: Host currently serving Telegram links
            (settings.telegram_link_domain), e.g. "telegram.me".

    Returns:
        The same URL with its host swapped for live_host, or the input
        unchanged if there is nothing to rewrite.

    Examples:
        >>> normalize_telegram_url("https://t.me/velobot?startapp=x", "telegram.me")
        'https://telegram.me/velobot?startapp=x'
        >>> normalize_telegram_url("https://cdn.example.com/a.jpg", "telegram.me")
        'https://cdn.example.com/a.jpg'
