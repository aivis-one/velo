# =============================================================================
# VELO Backend -- Transactional Outbox: OutboxEvent model (Phase 6 / T0)
# =============================================================================
#
# The domain-event outbox of integration design ID-2: a row in THIS
# table is written in THE SAME transaction as the domain change, and a
# background relay (relay.py) ships unpublished rows to the comms
# Redis Stream. Domain change committed <=> event committed; no
# distributed transaction, at-least-once by replay.
#
# WHY BIGSERIAL (BigInteger + Identity), NOT the project-wide UUID pk:
#   the relay publishes strictly in id order ("порядок по id", T0
#   item 3) -- a monotonically increasing integer IS the publication
#   order. Random UUIDs have no order; a timestamp is not unique.
#   This is a deliberate, documented deviation from UUIDMixin.
#
# PAYLOAD is the event's `data` document of the FROZEN comms wire
# contract (comms app/transport/events.py, Phase 3c), INCLUDING the
# required version field "v". The envelope {event, data} is assembled
# by the relay at XADD time -- storing data alone keeps the row 1:1
# with "everything that evolves lives inside data".
#
# LIFECYCLE COLUMNS:
#   published_at NULL   -> pending, the relay's scan predicate;
#   published_at ts     -> shipped (kept for audit; no deletes in T0);
#   attempts            -> failed publish attempts (observability +
#                          the poison-row WARN threshold; NEVER a drop
#                          limit -- outbox rows are not discarded).
#
# SESSION RULES: no commit here (P-01); emit_event() inserts into the
# caller's session/transaction.
