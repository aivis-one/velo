# =============================================================================
# VELO Backend -- Application Configuration (updated Phase 8.1, WARNING-5, NO-LITERALS)
# =============================================================================
#
# HOW IT WORKS:
#   1. pydantic-settings reads your .env file
#   2. Each field here maps to an environment variable (case-insensitive)
#   3. Pydantic validates types: if DATABASE_URL is missing or malformed,
#      the app crashes at startup with a clear error -- not at runtime
#      when a user triggers a database query.
#
# EXAMPLE:
#   .env contains:       DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://...
#   Python code uses:    settings.database_url  (typed as str, validated)
#
# WHY NOT just os.getenv()?
#   os.getenv("DATABSE_URL")  <- typo, returns None, crashes later
#   settings.databse_url      <- typo, IDE catches it immediately
#
# SECURITY (TD-001, TD-006):
#   In production (APP_ENV != development), SECRET_KEY and DATABASE_URL
#   have no defaults -- the app refuses to start without a proper .env.
#   In development, safe defaults are provided for convenience.
#
# WARNING-5: STRIPE_STUB is disallowed in production.
#   If STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="TEST", webhook signature verification is skipped.
#   The validator below raises at startup if this happens in production.
