# VELO Backend -- Refund Service (Phase 6.5, updated Phase 6.7 Batch 4)
# =============================================================================
#
# Refund and early-finalize logic for booking/practice cancellations.
#
# THREE SCENARIOS:
#
#   A) User cancels > 24h before practice (refund_booking):
#      - Reverse frozen master credit + refund user.
#      - No promo / Master promo:
#          master_ledger(-paid_cents, frozen) + user_ledger(+paid_cents)
#      - Company promo:
#          master_ledger(-amount_cents, frozen) + user_ledger(+paid_cents)
#          + company_ledger(+discount_cents, marketing reversal)
#      - Purchase -> REFUNDED.
#
#   B) User cancels <= 24h before practice (early_finalize_booking):
#      - Master keeps the money. Immediate unfreeze + commission.
#      - No promo / Master promo:
#          master_ledger(-paid_cents, frozen reversal)
#          master_ledger(+paid_cents, available)
#          master_ledger(-commission, available) + company_ledger(+commission)
#      - Company promo:
#          master_ledger(-amount_cents, frozen reversal)
#          master_ledger(+amount_cents, available)
#          master_ledger(-commission, available) + company_ledger(+commission)
#          (marketing debit stays -- practice was "consumed")
#      - Purchase -> COMPLETED.
#
#   C) Master cancels entire practice (refund_all_bookings_for_practice):
#      - 100% refund to every active booking (uses refund_booking).
#      - All waitlist entries -> left.
#      - Recalculate current_participants -> 0 (Frontend Backlog A-03).
#
# KEY PROMO INSIGHT:
#   "Master reversal amount" = what master originally received (frozen):
#   - No promo:      paid_cents (= price)
#   - Master promo:  paid_cents (master absorbed discount)
#   - Company promo: amount_cents (company covered gap, master got full price)
#
#   Helper _master_frozen_amount(purchase) encapsulates this logic.
#
# WHY REVERSAL, NOT UPDATE?
#   master_ledger entries don't carry booking_id, so we can't
#   target a specific frozen entry for UPDATE. Instead, we create
#   an offsetting negative frozen entry. When finalize_purchases
#   later runs bulk UPDATE (is_frozen=False), the original and
#   reversal cancel each other out -- cached balances stay correct.
#
# INVARIANTS:
#   - Every refund/early-finalize creates EVEN number of ledger entries
#   - SUM(all ledgers) = 0 after each operation
#   - Free practices (paid_cents=0) get zero-amount entries (proof of path)
#   - Purchase.status guards against double processing (idempotency)
#
# SESSION RULES:
#   No session.commit() (P-01). Caller manages transaction.
