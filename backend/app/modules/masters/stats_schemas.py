# Period-scoped stat grid for the master dashboard. All counts are for the
# current calendar period (week|month, UTC); each *_delta_pct is the signed
# percent change vs the previous period, or null when there is no meaningful
# base (S-1: previous period was non-positive) -- the client renders "--".

# Class name is Master-prefixed to avoid OpenAPI component-name collisions.
