# =============================================================================
# VELO Backend -- Master Reviews Schemas (#3 -- cross-practice attention feed)
# =============================================================================
#
# Master-wide named-reviews feed across the master's completed practices.
# Refines E1 (per-practice GET /practices/{id}/reviews): same de-anonymised
# projection, but aggregated over ALL of the master's completed practices and
# carrying the NEW practice_title field so the dashboard "Требуют внимания"
# block can show which practice each review came from.
#
# Class names are Master-prefixed and distinct from diary's ReviewItem to
# avoid OpenAPI component-name collisions in the generated frontend types.
# rating is the UI bucket name (fire / good / confused), same vocabulary E1
# already returns, so the frontend reuses its rating icons.
