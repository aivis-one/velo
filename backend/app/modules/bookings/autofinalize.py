# =============================================================================
# VELO Backend -- Practice Lifecycle Worker (Batch 1, extended)
# =============================================================================
#
# Background asyncio.Task that runs inside FastAPI lifespan, mirroring the
# notification processor (app/modules/notifications/processor.py).
#
# WHY:
#   Practices are driven by the clock -- the master no longer starts or finishes
#   a practice by hand. Without this worker a practice would stay scheduled
#   forever: it would never go live, its confirmed bookings would never resolve
#   to attended/no_show, the master's money would stay frozen, and the feedback
#   prompt would never fire. This worker performs BOTH time-based transitions,
#   acting as the system actor.
#
# HOW (two phases per poll, FINISH before START):
#   FINISH: practices WHERE status IN (scheduled, live) AND
#           scheduled_at + duration_minutes + buffer <= now. Each runs the full
#           settlement core via bookings.service.auto_finalize_practice
#           (attendance + ledger unfreeze/commission + diary projection +
#           feedback push).
#   START:  practices WHERE status == scheduled AND scheduled_at <= now AND the
#           scheduled END has NOT passed. Each moves scheduled -> live via
#           bookings.service.auto_start_practice (status only -- no bookings,
#           money or diary are touched).
#
#   FINISH runs first on purpose: a practice whose start AND end have both
#   already passed (e.g. the worker was down for a while) is caught by FINISH
#   and goes straight to completed -- it never flickers through live. START only
#   ever sees practices whose end is still in the future.
#
# SESSION / ISOLATION:
#   Runs outside request context -- uses get_session_factory() like the
#   notification processor and the Stripe webhook. Each practice is transitioned
#   in its OWN session/transaction: FINISH settlement touches money + diary and
#   is comparatively heavy, so we isolate failures (one bad practice must not
#   roll back the others) and hold the FOR UPDATE lock only for that practice.
#   START is light but uses the same per-practice isolation for symmetry.
#
#   Both phases claim rows with FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED, so a row already locked
#   by the other phase (or a concurrent op) is simply skipped this tick and
#   picked up next cycle -- no double transition, no deadlock.
#
# BACKOFF:
#   Empty poll (nothing started or finished) -> interval doubles (up to
#   max_backoff). Any work found -> reset.
#
# ERROR HANDLING:
#   Each practice is transitioned independently. One failure is logged and the
#   loop continues. Unhandled exceptions in the main loop are caught, logged,
#   and the loop continues after backoff.
