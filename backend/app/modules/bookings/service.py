# =============================================================================
# VELO Backend -- Booking Service (Phase 5.1+5.2+5.3+5.4+6.5+6.7, Backlog)
# =============================================================================
#
# Business logic for booking create, cancel, attendance, finalize,
# and user-facing list/detail endpoints (Frontend Backlog).
#
# STATE MACHINE:
#   pending   -> confirmed, cancelled
#   confirmed -> attended, no_show, cancelled
#   attended  -> (terminal)
#   no_show   -> (terminal)
#   cancelled -> (terminal)
#
# ATTENDANCE + LIFECYCLE (Phase 5.4; Batch 1 -- time-driven, no manual path):
#   join_booking:           sets joined_at (status stays confirmed)
#   leave_booking:          sets left_at (requires joined_at)
#   auto_start_practice:    scheduled -> live once the start time has passed
#                           (system actor; called by the autofinalizer worker)
#   auto_finalize_practice: scheduled/live -> completed once the end has passed
#                           confirmed + (joined_at OR PRE check-in) -> attended
#                           confirmed + neither                     -> no_show
#                           (system actor; shared core _finalize_practice_core)
#
# PURCHASE INTEGRATION (Phase 6.4):
#   create_booking:         creates Purchase + double-entry ledger (always, even free)
#   auto_finalize_practice: finalizes Purchases (unfreeze + commission)
#
# PROMO INTEGRATION (Phase 6.7 Batch 4):
#   create_booking: optional promo param, passed to create_purchase_for_booking.
#   Promo validation happens in the caller (router or purchase_router).
#
# CANCELLATION POLICY (Phase 6.5):
#   cancel_booking now handles refunds based on deadline:
#     > cancellation_deadline_hours before practice -> 100% refund
#     <= cancellation_deadline_hours before practice -> 0% refund (early finalize)
#   Both paths produce double-entry ledger entries (even for free practices).
#
# PARTICIPANT COUNT (Frontend Backlog A-03):
#   recalculate_participants() updates Practice.current_participants
#   after every booking status change.
#
# CAPACITY:
#   Checked via COUNT of active bookings, not current_participants (TD-034).
#
# WAITLIST INTEGRATION (Phase 5.3):
#   After cancelling a booking, process_waitlist is called.
#
# SESSION RULES:
#   No session.commit() here (P-01). Router handles flush + refresh.
#
# B-05: list_user_bookings uses subquery pattern for count (same as
#   list_user_checkins in diary/checkins_service.py). Eliminates parallel
#   count_base query that required manual filter duplication.

    Caller MUST pass a practice that is already loaded FOR UPDATE and already
    validated to be in a finalizable state (_FINALIZABLE_PRACTICE_STATUSES).
    This is the single source of truth for what "finalizing a practice" means.
    It is reached only through the system auto-close path
    (auto_finalize_practice), invoked by the lifecycle worker once the practice's
    scheduled end has passed (the manual master finalize was removed in Batch 1).
    Keeping one core means attendance, money, and the diary are always settled
    the same way.

    Transitions:
    - NO active Zoom meeting: confirmed + (joined_at IS NOT NULL OR PRE
      check-in) -> attended, else -> no_show. Decided HERE, immediately, tagged
      legacy_proxy (unchanged from before E21 step F -- covers practices
      published before Zoom shipped).
    - HAS an active Zoom meeting (E21 step F): confirmed bookings are
      DEFERRED -- left exactly as CONFIRMED, NOT flipped here, NOT included
      in this call's diary projection or feedback push. They are decided
      later by zoom/report_poller.py (Zoom's report ripens ~15 min after a
      meeting ends, so deciding at THIS moment would almost always just be
      "not ready yet"), or by that module's deadline fallback if Zoom's
      report never arrives within settings.zoom_attendance_decision_deadline_
      minutes. See zoom/attendance_service.py's module docstring for the
      full mechanism this defers to.
    - Practice status -> completed (UNCONDITIONALLY, regardless of the above)
    - All pending purchases -> completed (unfreeze + commission) --
      UNCONDITIONALLY. Money settlement was never gated on attended/no_show
      in this codebase and E21 does not change that; deferring the
      attendance decision does not defer the money.

    `actor` is logged only (currently always "system") -- it does not change
    behavior. Session rules unchanged (P-01): no commit here.
