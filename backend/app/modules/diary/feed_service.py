#
# The unified timeline query layer: reads the append-only DiaryEvent journal
# built by diary/projections.py. A distinct bounded concern from the entry/
# checkin/feedback write paths above -- it operates on DiaryEvent, not
# DiaryEntry/Checkin/Feedback, and has zero coupling to their service
# functions (only the already-extracted projections module writes the
# journal it reads). No external consumers outside diary/router.py.

            practices) -> resolved to event kinds. None -> all.
        date_from / date_to: bound occurred_at.
        search: case-insensitive ilike over the denormalized text_search.
        cursor: opaque `(occurred_at, id)` pair packed by _encode_cursor; the
            next page returns events strictly OLDER than that pair, in total
            order.

    Returns:
        Tuple of (events, next_cursor). next_cursor packs the last returned
        event's (occurred_at, id) when a full page was returned, else None
        (end of feed). The caller echoes it back verbatim as `cursor` for the
        next page -- it is opaque to it and always was (useCursorPagination.ts,
        api/diary.ts never parse/construct/compare the value).

    SW12 fix, 2026-08-17: occurred_at is NOT unique across events -- a series
    cancellation deliberately stamps ONE shared instant on every sibling it
    fans out (cancel_service.py, comment "W-3"), and project_practice_cancelled
    then writes one DiaryEvent per booked user per sibling with that same
    occurred_at. A plain occurred_at cursor silently and permanently drops
    whichever tied rows didn't make the page before the cursor advanced past
    their timestamp, because Postgres does not order ties and `< cursor`
    excludes them on every subsequent page. Total-ordering on (occurred_at, id)
    closes it -- id is a UUID (no chronological meaning) but it is a stable,
    deterministic secondary key, which is all a tiebreaker needs.

    THIS DOES CHANGE THE DECLARED API TYPE, contrary to what this docstring
    used to claim: `cursor`/`next_cursor` move from a `datetime`-typed field to
    an opaque `str`-typed one (router.py, schemas.py), because a packed
    "timestamp|uuid" value is not a valid datetime and FastAPI would reject it
    at the query-param layer otherwise. The frontend was already treating the
    field as opaque (confirmed: `useCursorPagination.ts`, `api/diary.ts`,
    `api/utils.ts` never parse/compare it), and this codegen already collapses
    every `datetime`-typed field to a plain TS `string` (checked: every
    created_at/updated_at in generated.ts), so the regenerated
    `next_cursor`/`cursor` TS type is `string | null` both before and after --
    unchanged. The claim that survives is narrower than the one this docstring
    used to make: no FRONTEND code changes, but the backend's own OpenAPI
    schema for this field does change shape (format: date-time is dropped).
