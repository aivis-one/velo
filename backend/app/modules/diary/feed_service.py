# VELO Backend -- Diary Feed Service (Diary redesign iteration,

# =============================================================================
#
# The unified timeline query layer: reads the append-only DiaryEvent journal
# built by diary/projections.py. A distinct bounded concern from the entry/
# checkin/feedback write paths above -- it operates on DiaryEvent, not
# DiaryEntry/Checkin/Feedback, and has zero coupling to their service
# functions (only the already-extracted projections module writes the
# journal it reads). No external consumers outside diary/router.py.
