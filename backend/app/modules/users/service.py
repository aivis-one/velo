# =============================================================================
# VELO Backend — Users Service
# =============================================================================
#
# RESPONSIBILITIES:
#   1. Get user by ID
#   2. Update user profile (partial update)
#
# PATTERN:
#   Functions accept AsyncSession and return ORM objects.
#   Router handles HTTP concerns, service handles domain logic.
#
# TD-029 fix: removed session.merge() from update_user.
#   Previously the user came from get_current_user (read-only session),
#   requiring an explicit merge into the write session. Now the router
#   uses get_current_user_write, which loads the user via the same
#   get_db_session instance as the endpoint — merge is unnecessary.
#
# ONBOARDING:
#   onboarding_completed is not a column -- it lives in the credentials
#   JSONB sandbox. update_user routes it there via set_jsonb() (JSONBMixin),
#   which flag_modified()s the column so SQLAlchemy emits the UPDATE.
#   Plain setattr would target a non-existent column and silently no-op.
