# ONBOARDING (welcome flow):
#   onboarding_completed is NOT a DB column. It lives inside the
#   credentials JSONB sandbox (key "onboarding_completed"), following the
#   "schema-on-read until it stabilizes, then extract to a column" pattern.
#   - UserResponse exposes it as a top-level bool (computed from credentials),

#   - UserUpdate accepts it so the welcome carousel can mark it done via
#     PATCH /users/me. The service writes it back into credentials.
