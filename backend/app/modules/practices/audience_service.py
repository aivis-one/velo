#
# ONE shared predicate for "can this viewer see/book/check into this
# practice" -- reused (not duplicated) by:
#   - practices/listing_service.py list_public_practices (SQL filter, via
#     viewer_audience_clause)
#   - bookings/service.py create_booking (the P1->P5 carried seam)
#   - waitlist/service.py confirm_waitlist (the OTHER booking-creation path
#     -- also closes the carried seam; a blocked/out-of-audience user must
#     not be able to convert a held waitlist notification into a booking
#     either)
#   - diary/checkins_service.py upsert_checkin -- via
#     assert_viewer_not_blocked ONLY (retroactive policy (B), H-R2-8):
#     a CONFIRMED booking grandfathers the holder through audience
#     narrowing; a personal block still refuses the check-in action
# via assert_viewer_can_access_practice below.
#
# RULE: viewer is NOT blocked by the practice's master (master_student.
# blocked_at) AND (audience=public) OR (audience=students AND viewer has
# >=1 non-cancelled booking on that master's practices -- the same derived
# "Ученики" rule groups_service.py uses) OR (audience=groups AND viewer is
# a member of >=1 of the practice's target groups).
#
# The three _*_clause() functions are the single source of truth for each
# condition -- both viewer_audience_clause (composes all three into one SQL
# WHERE-clause boolean, correlated to the module-level Practice table) and
# assert_viewer_can_access_practice (evaluates them one at a time against an
# already-loaded practice, to raise the RIGHT specific error code) call the
# SAME functions. Nothing here is reimplemented twice.

    Codes: "blocked_by_master", "not_a_student", "not_in_audience" (the
    groups case, also the fail-closed default for an unrecognized
    audience_kind -- see below). Frontend maps each to its own Russian
    message -- see diary/checkins_service.py upsert_checkin's docstring for
    the exact strings and where they surface.

    OWNER BYPASS (P5 hardening, PROMPT №596): matches list_public_practices's
    own `or_(Practice.master_id == user.id, viewer_audience_clause(user.id))`
    filter (listing_service.py) -- so the gate and the feed filter agree by
    construction, not by caller discipline. VERIFIED INERT today: every call
    site already rejects a master acting on their OWN practice BEFORE ever
    reaching this function --
      - create_booking: `if practice.master_id == user.id: raise
        BadRequestError("Cannot book your own practice")`
        (bookings/service.py:240-241)

    through audience NARROWING (an impersonal reconfiguration must not
    strip access already paid for -- the R2 symmetry), while a personal
    BLOCK (targeted moderation) still refuses the check-in ACTION.
    Check-in therefore calls assert_viewer_not_blocked below -- ONLY the
    blocked probe, with the audience branches structurally unreachable
    rather than flag-disabled. The four remaining callers of the full
    predicate (create_booking, join_waitlist, confirm_waitlist,

    the audience gate stays fully alive for NEW acquisitions.

    OWNER BYPASS mirrored from the parent (P5 hardening, ПРОМТ №596),

    CONFIRMED Booking, and a booking can only be created via the gated
    paths (create_booking / confirm_waitlist), both of which reject a
    master acting on their own practice. Kept anyway so this function,
    like its parent, does not depend on that caller discipline
    continuing to hold.

    FLOW NOTE (defense in depth, verified H-R2-8): the live block flow
    (groups_service.block_student) cancels+refunds the student's FUTURE
    confirmed bookings, and the check-in window closes AT scheduled_at
    -- so any practice still check-in-able is "future" and its booking
    is cancelled by the block itself, landing on the booking-first
    NotFound. This 403 is therefore reachable only if blocked_at and a
    CONFIRMED booking coexist (flow changes, re-confirmation after an
    unblock..re-block, or direct state) -- kept as the belt to that
    flow's suspenders, not dead code.
