# =============================================================================
# VELO Backend -- Practice Service (Phase 4.2 + 4.3/4.4, updated Phase 6.5,
#                                   updated Frontend F3 prep, + Calendar taxonomy)
# =============================================================================
#
# Business logic for practice CRUD (master-facing) and public listing.
#
# MASTER_NAME / MASTER_METHODS (Frontend F3 prep, DS-sprint):
#   practice_to_response() builds PracticeResponse with master_name and
#   master_methods. master_name is the full "First Last" name, built by
#   master_full_name() from User.first_name + User.last_name in every JOIN /
#   mutation path (MVP rule: Telegram name, surname appended only if present).
#   master_methods come from MasterProfile.data via OUTER JOIN; get_practice()
#   outer-joins MasterProfile to return methods. If MasterProfile is missing,
#   master_methods defaults to [].
#   List functions pass master_methods=[] (methods not shown in list cards).
#
# CALENDAR TAXONOMY (Calendar iteration):
#   direction / style / difficulty are catalog facets stored in the
#   Practice.data JSONB sandbox under data.taxonomy (schema-on-read). They
#   are NOT columns:
#     - create_practice() writes them into data.taxonomy via set_jsonb().
#     - update_practice() handles them in a SEPARATE JSONB branch -- they are
#       pulled out of update_data BEFORE the setattr() loop, otherwise
#       setattr(practice, "direction", ...) would create a dead Python
#       attribute that never reaches the DB (same trap as onboarding_completed
#       in users/service.py).
#     - practice_to_response() extracts them back out for the API response.
#   JSONB SAFETY: always deepcopy + set_jsonb("data", ...). Never mutate
#   practice.data in place (SQLAlchemy would miss the change).
#
# OWNERSHIP:
#   All mutating operations (update, delete, cancel) verify master_id == user.id.
#   Non-owners receive 404 (P-08: do not reveal resource existence).
#   get_practice() applies visibility rules: draft/deleted only for owner.
#
# STATE MACHINE:
#   draft          -> scheduled, deleted   (via PATCH)
#   scheduled      -> live                  (auto, by schedule -- NOT via PATCH)
#   scheduled/live -> completed             (auto, by schedule -- NOT via PATCH)
#   completed      -> (terminal)
#   cancelled      -> (terminal)
#   deleted        -> (terminal)
#
# IMPORTANT (Phase 6.5):
#   scheduled -> cancelled and live -> cancelled are NOT allowed via PATCH.
#   The ONLY path to cancelled is through cancel_practice() which handles
#   refunds for all active bookings.
#
# IMPORTANT (Batch 1 -- lifecycle automation):
#   scheduled -> live and live -> completed are NO LONGER allowed via PATCH
#   either. Both are performed by the background lifecycle worker
#   (bookings/autofinalize.py) as the system, driven by the clock:
#     start:  scheduled -> live      once scheduled_at passes;
#     finish: scheduled/live -> completed once scheduled_at + duration passes
#             (auto_finalize_practice runs the full settlement core).
#   So PATCH only ever drives draft -> scheduled (publish) and draft -> deleted.
#
# PRICING (Phase 4.3/4.4):
#   is_free=True  -> price_cents forced to 0 (service overrides any value)
#   is_free=False -> price_cents must be > 0 (service raises 400)
#
# CONCURRENCY:
#   update_practice(), delete_practice(), and cancel_practice() use
#   with_for_update() (P-12) to prevent lost updates on status transitions.
#
# DELETE vs CANCEL:
#   DELETE sets status=deleted (only from draft).
#   CANCEL sets status=cancelled + refunds all bookings (Phase 6.5).
#
# SESSION RULES:
#   No session.commit() here (P-01). Router handles flush + refresh.

# update. Only on a config MISS is the catalog queried, and that query is
# wrapped so ANY read error degrades to "not found" rather than propagating
# -- the only thing an outage can cost is a catalog-only value. Only ACTIVE
# catalog rows count, matching GET /api/v1/taxonomy's own contract.
# difficulty has no catalog table and is validated in schemas.py, unchanged.

    Deliberately does NOT read method_change_request.proposed_methods: a
    pending, unapproved request must never unlock a practice in that
    direction, or the "up to 3 working days" review the UI advertises would
    mean nothing.

    FAILS OPEN (does not restrict) when the master's confirmed methods list
    is EMPTY -- not a loophole, a reflection of reality: a real verified
    master always has at least one confirmed method (masters/schemas.py's
    MasterApplicationRequest requires min_length=1 at application time), so
    an empty list here means either a test fixture that never set up
    profile.methods at all, or a data state that should not be reachable in
    production. Restricting THAT case would be enforcing a rule against
    data that predates the rule, not the rule itself.

    STORED FORMAT IS MIXED (T21-7, ПРОМТ №547, MEASURED on prod): a method
    entry is a frozen catalog LABEL ("Йога — Кундалини-йога") when it was
    written by the wizard (flattenMethods/approve_method_change), but a raw
    catalog VALUE ("yoga") when it was written directly against the API --
    every seed-based master, ~30 backend test fixtures, and at least one live
    prod master (no wizard round-trip ever touched their profile) all store
    values, not labels. The original label-only check treated every entry as
    a label, so it rejected every real, correctly-confirmed direction a
    value-stored master holds.

    Canonical form = VALUE, not label: `direction`/`style` here are ALREADY
    values (the wire format for practice taxonomy), labels are just a
    renamable display string with no version pin, and a value-stored entry
    (the common case: raw seed/API data) needs zero catalog round-trip to
    compare -- only a label-stored entry needs one reverse lookup (label ->
    is this the CURRENT label for the direction/style being requested?).
    So each stored entry is compared against BOTH representations of the
    SAME requested (direction, style): the raw value, and -- if the
    requested direction/style currently has an active catalog row -- its
    current label. Mirrors the frontend's parseMethods split (same SEP,
    same "both halves must resolve" rule for a composite entry) but compares
    toward values instead of building a label to search for, which also
    sidesteps parseMethods' label-drift limitation on this comparison (we
    never resolve a STORED label into a value; we only ever check whether it
    still equals the CURRENT label of the specific direction/style being
    requested).

    A composite entry ("Направление — Вид") is confirmation for that EXACT
    style only -- it does NOT also confirm the bare parent direction (no
    style), and a bare-direction entry does NOT confirm any specific style
    under it. Deliberate, unchanged from before this fix, and matches
    CreatePracticeView.vue's confirmedMethods filter (directionOptions/
    styleOptionsForForm), which already documents and relies on this same
    strict split.

    A STORED entry that resolves to nothing recognizable (neither half
    matches the requested value or label representation -- a stale/custom
    entry, or one written against a since-deactivated/renamed catalog row)
    simply confirms nothing: it is skipped, not an error, and does not by
    itself cause a reject -- the request is rejected only if NO entry in the
    whole list confirms it. If the REQUESTED direction itself has no active
    catalog row at all (dir_label is None below), this still fails OPEN
    exactly as before this fix -- unrelated to the mixed-format bug and
    deliberately not touched here (out of scope for T21-7; see the fail-open
    branch below for the original rationale).
