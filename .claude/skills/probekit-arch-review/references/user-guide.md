# arch-review — User Guide

## What It Does

Evaluates the structural quality of any codebase against universal architecture principles.
Checks 10 dimensions: modularity, coupling, cohesion, layering, consistency, error design,
data flow, scalability, testability, and evolvability.

## How to Invoke

```
/arch-review src/                          # Review directory (quality mode)
/arch-review src/ -- focus on coupling     # Review with focus hint
/arch-review src/ --fix                    # Review + auto-fix critical/warning
/arch-review framework/services/llm/       # Review specific module
```

## What You Get

- **Architecture Snapshot:** Brief structural overview
- **10-Section Analysis:** Module boundaries, dependencies, coupling, layers, patterns,
  errors, data flow, scalability, testability, evolution readiness
- **Pattern Quality Scan:** Diamond patterns (good) and anti-patterns (bad)
- **Balance Scorecard:** 10-dimension score with weighted average
- **Quality Gate:** PASS / WARN / FAIL with reasoning
- **Top Recommendations:** 3 most impactful improvements
