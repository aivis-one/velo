# ZOD BACKEND TASKS — consolidated backend wishlist (user / master / admin)

> **Priority legend.**
> - **P0** — a screen that is already built does **not function** without this. Highest urgency.
> - **P1** — the endpoint exists or the screen partly works; this **enriches** a partially-working screen.
> - **P2** — nice-to-have; the screen is usable without it.

## ⚡ LANE BOUNDARY (operator, 2026-07-15) — read this before assigning anything below

**Zod's lane is: messaging · notifications · E21 Zoom-attendance-tracking · support-ticket intake
(rides the messaging module). Everything else in this document is OWNED-BY-NAV.**

The test is **delivery-through-the-messaging-module**, not "does it involve text" or "does it look
like a small backend one-liner". Support-ticket intake reads like a standalone form in isolation, but
it ships through the messaging module Zod is building, so it stays his — a plausible-looking table and
endpoint is not, on its own, grounds to reassign it. E21 stays his too, by explicit operator call, even
though attendance-tracking is not itself messaging/notifications.

**Exception, same date: E13 (master-application document upload) is ALSO Zod's, for a different
reason than the four lane items above.** It fails the delivery-through-messaging test outright —
document upload is not his kind of feature. It is reassigned anyway (operator decision, 2026-07-15)
because its blocker is **infrastructure Zod owns and has not yet built: S3 is not connected, and there
is no file storage anywhere in this project.** The exception is to the blocker, not the feature — see
E13's own STATUS line for the same reasoning. Revisit if storage ever lands independently of Zod's build.

Any marker elsewhere in this doc that still says "OPEN — Zod" / "Zod's part" / "Zod add" etc. for
anything OUTSIDE the four-item lane above OR the E13 exception is stale and should be corrected on
sight, not treated as current. This block is the single source of truth for the boundary — do not
re-derive it from scattered epic text.

## ⏱ STATUS — actualized 2026-06-28 (re-verified against live `generated.ts` on `origin/test=4713c60`)

Each epic carries a **STATUS** line. Numbering / names unchanged so they map 1:1 to Zod's version.
**E12–E17 are new** (post-audit gaps: E12–E14 + E15 master-onboarding-flag / E16 apply-languages /
E17 master-web-auth, all added 2026-06-26/27). Re-audited field-by-field vs the live `4713c60`
contract. **Sole status change since 2026-06-24: E8 OPEN → PARTIAL** (master-notifications contract +
capability gate delivered). Everything else unchanged, no regression. One-glance state:

- **DELIVERED (do not rebuild):** **E1** named reviews · **E2** income/ledger+transactions ·
  **E5** students/CRM · **E7** period stats (master + admin) · **E9 (core)** admin practices/revenue/metrics.
- **PARTIAL (some delivered, a remainder open):** **E3** (create-recurrence done; PATCH-edit open) ·
  **E8** ⬆ (master-notifications contract `MasterNotificationSettings` gen:486 + on UserResponse gen:1118
  /UserUpdate gen:1138 + master-capability gate DELIVERED; push-delivery worker + unread bell-feed open) ·
  **E9** (rich masters/reports/withdrawals open) · **E10** (POST done; GET-list + DELETE open) ·
  **E11** (real `DELETE /users/me` + `UserResponse.email` done №280; rest open) · **E1** (cross-practice needs-attention *filter* DONE №280).
- **OPEN (untouched, field absent on `4713c60`):** **E4** messaging · **E6** weekly summary ·
  **E12** checkin_count · **E13** apply-doc/photo-upload · **E14** application rejection_reason ·
  **E15** master_onboarding_completed · **E16** apply languages · **E17** master web-auth (PARKED).
- **Delivered OUTSIDE the epic set (not E-numbered):** auto-complete-by-duration (lifecycle worker);
  **W-6/W-7** (user dashboard full attended-stats + bookings load-more, commit `028ae7e`); plus
  frontend/test self-fixes (`StudentDetailResponse.name/avatar`, admin-metrics test isolation) — for
  coordination, not Zod work.

---

## ⏱ SELF-BUILT THIS BATCH — 2026-07-06 (T1–T5 + Bug2, HELD ahead-8 on `54bdf0a`; coordination, NOT Zod work — do not rebuild)

We self-built the following this session under the backend-exception (additive / JSONB / config,
no migration). Recorded here so Zod sees the new surfaces and avoids collision. Deploy delta
`ca66e0e..54bdf0a` = 11 commits (our 8 + Zod's Z-7 zoom-factory `0e3f280` / R-1 clear-admin-marker
`da98d56` / regen `39bdc31`). **Zero migration** across all 11.

**Additive endpoints / contract (self-built, live after deploy):**
- `POST /admin/users/{id}/make-master` (T2) — explicit admin grant: create-or-re-verify the
  `MasterProfile` **and** set `role=master` **and** clear the switched-away-admin marker
  (`credentials_without_admin_home`, shared with R-1). `409 already_master` if already master.
- `GET /admin/masters/{id}` → `AdminMasterDetail` (T3) — real methods / experience / bio for review.
- `PATCH /admin/masters/{id}/methods` → `EditMasterMethodsRequest` (T3) — admin edits a master's
  flat method set during review (min 1 / max 20). Distinct from the M3 master-side change-request.
- `UserResponse.master_application: MasterApplicationInfo | None` on `GET /me` (T5) — reject-visibility
  so a role=`user` applicant sees the verdict (reason) on `MasterPendingView`.
- **Generic Redis invite (T5, replaces the account-bound ID-invite):** `POST /admin/masters/invite`
  now takes **no body** (was `{telegram_id}`), stores `master_invite:{sha256(token)}` → `{issued_by,
  issued_at}` in Redis with **no TTL**, returns the composed `?startapp=master_onboarding__<token>`
  link (`503 bot_url_not_configured` if `TELEGRAM_BOT_URL` unset). `POST /masters/invite/claim` burns
  the token atomically (`GETDEL`; first-claim-wins, unknown/consumed → `404 invite_invalid`); any
  authenticated opener may claim. The account-bound `credentials.master_invite` writer/reader path is
  **removed** (schema `InviteMasterRequest` deleted; own-marker hash-compare gone).

**T4 role/capability pivot (behavior change, no contract field):** `verify_master` (application
approval) now sets `status=verified` **ONLY** — it no longer flips `User.role`. The applicant gains
master *capability* and self-switches via the existing `POST /users/me/role` (`derive_allowed_roles`
keys on `status=="verified"`). `get_current_master` still requires `role=master` AND verified, so a
verified-but-not-switched account is correctly gated. `make_master` (T2) is the one path that flips
role (explicit grant).

**generated.ts hand-adds reconciling at deploy regen (zero expected type-drift):** added
`AdminMasterDetail`, `EditMasterMethodsRequest`, `MasterApplicationInfo`; removed `InviteMasterRequest`.
All have backing backend schemas (or, for the removal, none), so a clean OpenAPI regen matches.

**Known FOLLOW-UPS (self / later — NOT asking Zod to action now):**
- **Consistency semaphore 1.3 redefinition.** T4 creates a valid `verified` profile with `role=user`
  (approved-but-not-yet-self-switched). Semaphore `1.3_master_users_eq_verified_profiles`
  (`role∈{master,admin}` count == verified-profile count) therefore diverges in that transient window
  — a **monitoring-only ALERT** on the (parked) admin DB-integrity screen; no functional/test impact
  (no test approves-then-asserts-OK). When that screen is un-parked, redefine 1.3 to count the
  pending-self-switch state (verified profile whose owner is still role=user).
- **Free-text custom-method add** in the T3 methods editor (currently pick from the fixed set).
- **Cross-session persistent reject indicator** in the user zone (today the verdict shows via
  `/me master_application` on the pending screen only).
- **Durable `MasterInvite` table** if the Redis-ephemeral invite proves insufficient (a Redis flush
  drops unburned tokens; acceptable for now — admin regenerates).

## Environment note — admin/finance seed data

Originally the admin/finance domains had no seed, so admin screens rendered empty even where the
contract existed. **UPDATE 2026-06-24:** a priced + `as_master` seed now populates masters / practices
/ participants / check-ins / reviews on TEST, so master + most admin screens render real values. The
admin **consistency / withdrawals** domains may still need dedicated seed coverage. This is an
**environment / seed-script gap, not a backend-contract gap** — do not assume an admin endpoint is
missing just because a less-seeded screen looks thin.

---

## Grounding facts (verified in `generated.ts`; ⟳ = updated 2026-06-24)

**Already present in the backend (do NOT rebuild):**
- `GET /admin/stats` ⟳ now `AdminStatsOverviewResponse` (deltas/revenue/rates/period, gen:113),
  `GET /admin/masters` + verify/reject, `GET /admin/reports`, `GET/POST /admin/withdrawals` +
  approve/reject, `GET /admin/consistency`, `GET /admin/users`. ⟳ NEW since: `GET /admin/practices`
  (+/{id}) gen:567/59, `GET /admin/revenue` gen:97, `/admin/metrics/{check-in,feedback,return}`.
- Promo module: `POST /admin/promos`, `POST /masters/me/promos` (gen:320), `PaginatedPromosResponse`
  (gen:639), `promo_code` on booking. (GET-own-list + DELETE still absent — E10.)
- `email` exists on the master-application interface but ⟳ still NOT on `UserResponse` (gen:1059) — E11.
- Master balance `available_cents` / `frozen_cents` on `MasterProfileResponse`.
- `GET /practices/{id}/ai-summary` — a per-practice mock summary (NOT the weekly summary — E6).
- `GET /practices/{id}/attendance` → `AttendanceResponse` (gen:181) carries `attended`/`no_show`/
  `total`/`pending` + per-item projection. (The per-card LIST aggregate is still absent — E11.)

**Key contract shapes:**
- ⟳ `NotificationSettings` / `…Update` still carry **exactly four keys** (`push`, `practice_reminders`,
  `master_messages`, `support_messages`, gen:551) — the +9 master keys + `schedule` are still OPEN (E8).
- ⟳ `PracticeType` includes `'series'` AND now a real recurrence model exists: `RecurrenceSpec`
  (gen:876), `CreatePracticeRequest.recurrence` (gen:350), `recurrence_days`/`total_sessions`/
  `completed_sessions` on `PracticeResponse` (gen:765-767). **But `UpdatePracticeRequest` (gen:1032)
  has no `recurrence`** — edit-a-series is still OPEN (E3).
- ⟳ `ReportResponse` (gen:895) still carries `reporter_id` only — no category/priority/reporter_name/
  date filter (E9).
- ⟳ `AdminWithdrawalResponse` (gen:141) still has no master display name + no 2FA (E9).

## SELF-FIX LOG — batch №227 (2026-07-01, operator-authorized backend exception)

Minor gaps closed by us (backend projection + manual `generated.ts` + frontend wire), NOT Zod:
- **E18** `zoom_link` on `PracticeSummary` — from_attributes projection (no migration); `generated.ts` + Zoom wired (user dashboard / live / master dashboard).
- **E14** `rejection_reason` on `MasterProfileResponse` — projected from `data.account.rejection_reason` in the router; `MasterPendingView` shows the real reason.
- **E1 (increment)** `user_id` on `MasterReviewItem` + diary `ReviewItem` — projected from the joined `User`; per-practice review cards (`PracticeReviewsView`) navigate to the student profile. *(Attention-filter DONE №280: `getMasterReviews(…, attention)` + AnalyticsView «Требуют внимания» fetches `attention=true`; the backend param was already deployed. AnalyticsView attention card left on its existing message action pending operator UX call.)*
- **E10** GET `list_my_promos` + PATCH deactivate were already delivered by Zod — frontend now wired (`api/promos.ts` + `MasterPromocodesView`, active-list + soft-deactivate); no hard DELETE added.

**REASSIGNED (operator policy, 2026-07-15) — OWNED-BY-NAV, NOT Zod's lane.** These three were
originally deferred as small-but-Zod-hot one-liners; none of the three files is messaging/notifications,
so under the narrowed Zod lane (messaging + notifications only) they are ours:
- **E12** add a grouped-COUNT `checkin_count` to `PracticeResponse`/`PracticeSummary`, batched like `_series_meta_for_practices` (practices/service.py:372). OWNED-BY-NAV: practices/service.py (E3).
- **E15** mirror `onboarding_completed` → `master_onboarding_completed` on `UserResponse` + accept on PATCH-self (users/, credentials JSONB, service.py:45 frozenset). OWNED-BY-NAV: users/.
- **E3a** add `Practice.status != PracticeStatus.DELETED.value` to the occurrence-count filter (practices/service.py:427) — soft-deleted occurrences currently inflate `total_sessions`. OWNED-BY-NAV: E3 engine.

## A) EPICS

Each epic states **(a) why · (b) screens · (c) what breaks · (d) backend state**, plus a
**STATUS (2026-06-24)** line.

### E1 — Non-anonymous feedback (de-anonymise reviews). **P0.**
- **(a) Why.** Three master-facing screens must show *who* left a review and *what they wrote*; the
  insights endpoint is deliberately anonymous — de-anonymisation is a conscious new contract.
- **(b) Screens (3, ONE endpoint).** Master analytics → «Требуют внимания»; per-practice
  `PracticeReviewsView`; master past-practice detail → «Отзывы участников».
- **(c) Breaks.** All three sections rendered empty (numeric counts were real, named reviews missing).
- **(d) Backend.** `GET /practices/{id}/insights` is anonymous; no named-reviews endpoint existed.
- **Request.** NEW `GET /practices/{id}/reviews` → `{ reviewer_name, avatar, rating, comment,
  created_at }` + an attention filter (negative items only) so it serves both the per-practice list and
  the dashboard "needs attention" feed.
- **STATUS (2026-06-24): DELIVERED** — `GET /practices/{id}/reviews` → `PaginatedReviewsResponse`
  (gen:663), `ReviewItem` (gen:922), `getPracticeReviews` practices.ts:170. The **cross-practice**
  needs-attention feed (the former internal "#3") is also DELIVERED: `GET /masters/me/reviews` →
  `PaginatedMasterReviewsResponse` (gen:615) with `MasterReviewItem.practice_title` (gen:521).
  **CORRECTION (2026-07-04, ПРОМТ №280): the attention param was STALE-OPEN — it already ships.**
  `GET /masters/me/reviews?attention=true` narrows to the negative (confused) bucket server-side
  (`reviews_router.py` `attention: bool = Query`, `reviews_service.list_master_reviews`,
  `Feedback.rating <= ATTENTION_RATING_MAX`) and is LIVE on origin/test. E1-attention = **frontend
  wiring, now DONE**: `getMasterReviews(..., attention)` passes it; `AnalyticsView` «Требуют внимания»
  fetches `attention=true`. **Also OPEN: `MasterReviewItem` (gen:521) / `ReviewItem` (gen:922) carry no `user_id`** —
  the reviewer is name-only, so a review card cannot navigate to that student's profile. Add a reviewer
  `user_id` to the review item so the frontend can link a review → student profile. *(The per-practice
  `attention` filter EXISTS on the backend — test-verified — but the frontend wrapper doesn't pass it;
  that side is frontend-wiring, see section D.)*

### E2 — Income / ledger + transactions. **P0.**
- **(a) Why.** Income earned over a period + a transactions list. Balance ≠ income.
- **(b) Screens.** Master income (period-scoped) + transactions list. **Reused by** admin revenue (E9).
  *(Frontend-coordination: income/transactions are consumed by `AnalyticsView`, not `MasterFinanceView`
  — Finance = payout/withdrawal only.)*
- **(c) Breaks.** Income rendered «—»; transactions list empty.
- **(d) Backend.** Balance fields existed; no income/transaction API.
- **Requests.** NEW `GET /masters/me/income?period=week|month`; NEW `GET /masters/me/transactions`.
- **STATUS (2026-06-24): DELIVERED** — `IncomeResponse` (gen:442, `getIncome` masters.ts:145);
  `MasterTransactionItem` (gen:536) + `PaginatedTransactionsResponse` (gen:679, `getTransactions` :154).
- **⟳ ENRICHED 2026-06-25 (transaction title = practice name — recon item C).** The transactions list
  (AnalyticsView) shows a generic `MasterTransactionItem.title` («Оплата за практику» / «Комиссия»)
  because `MasterTransactionItem` (gen:536 = `title` / `created_at` / `counterparty_name` /
  `amount_cents`) carries **no practice reference** — no `practice_title` / `practice_id` exists on it
  (verified, grep: `practice_title` is absent app-wide). Operator wants the PRACTICE NAME on sale/refund
  rows. Add `practice_title` (and/or `practice_id`) to `MasterTransactionItem` for sale/refund rows so
  the list shows which practice the payment was for; commission / platform-side rows have no practice
  and keep «Комиссия». The frontend will then render `practice_title` when present, falling back to
  `title`. **P1.**

### E3 — Recurrence / series engine. **P1.**
- **(a) Why.** Create/Edit lets a master configure a repeating practice; `series` was a label only.
- **(b) Screens.** Master Create/Edit → «Повторение»; practices list (weekday line + "N of M left");
  WI-B cancel-scope.
- **(c) Breaks.** Recurrence period/weekdays/end/count were captured-only (not sent); cancel had no scope.
- **(d) Backend.** `series` tag persisted; no recurrence model; cancel had no scope.
- **Requests.** EXTEND `POST/PATCH /practices`: `recurrence{period,days_of_week,end,count}` + instance
  generation. EXTEND `POST /practices/{id}/cancel`: `scope`.
- **STATUS (2026-06-24): PARTIAL.** DELIVERED: `RecurrenceSpec` (gen:876),
  `CreatePracticeRequest.recurrence` (gen:350), `CancelPracticeRequest.scope` (gen:253),
  `recurrence_days`/`total_sessions`/`completed_sessions` on `PracticeResponse` (gen:765-767).
  **OPEN:** `UpdatePracticeRequest` (gen:1032) has **no `recurrence`** → `PATCH /practices/{id}` cannot
  edit an existing series' recurrence. Add it + regenerate the affected child instances on edit.
- **⟳ ENRICHED 2026-06-25 (master practice card/list recon — items 1/5/6).** (1) **Daily series renders
  «Регулярная», not «Ежедневно»:** `PracticeResponse` returns `recurrence_days` but **no `period`**, and
  a daily series sends **no days** on create (`CreatePracticeView.buildRecurrence` — "Daily ignores
  days"), so the frontend receives empty `recurrence_days` and cannot distinguish daily from generic.
  Fix — either expose `period` on `PracticeResponse`, OR (zero-FE-change) have the backend populate
  `recurrence_days=[1..7]` for a daily series so the existing `recurrenceDaysLabel()` already renders
  «Ежедневно». (2) **Series occurrences invisible in «Предстоящие»:** the list renders exactly what
  `GET /masters/me/practices` returns; if the engine emits only the parent series row (no per-occurrence
  projection), individual dated occurrences never appear. Need the list to surface generated occurrences.
  (3) **Deleting one occurrence removes the whole series from the list:** cancel has `scope` (gen:253,
  DELIVERED) but DELETE has none. Define a delete scope (this-occurrence vs whole-series) mirroring
  cancel, so removing one date does not kill the series.
- **⟳ ENRICHED 2026-06-26 (seed-phase recon — series occurrence-count metadata).** The "N of M left"
  count query (`service.py:427`) filters `status != CANCELLED` but **not** `status != DELETED`, so a
  soft-deleted draft occurrence is still counted in the series total. Minor metadata skew only — **never a
  data wipe** (confirmed by code read: `delete_practice` is draft-only + single-row soft-delete + no cascade;
  `cancel_practice` is correctly series-scoped via `root_expr==root_id ∧ scheduled_at>=primary`). Fix: add
  `Practice.status != PracticeStatus.DELETED.value` to the count filter. **P3 (cosmetic).**

### E4 — Messaging module. **P1.**
- **(a) Why.** Real one-to-one messaging across all zones (list, thread, send, unread). No conversation/
  message entity exists; `master_messages`/`support_messages` are notification toggles, not a store.
- **(b) Screens (one module).** Master Messages/Chat; students «Написать сообщение»; check-in bubbles;
  hub «Сообщения N»; admin → user; **user → master «Вопрос мастеру»** (public profile + booking-confirmed);
  the support thread (see E11).
- **(c) Breaks.** Sample data everywhere; every send raises «недоступно»; unread stubbed to 0.
- **(d) Backend.** No conversation/message entity.
- **Requests.** NEW `GET /conversations`; `GET/POST /conversations/{id}/messages`;
  `GET /conversations/unread-total`. Decide: is «Поддержка VELΘ» a real thread or a separate channel?
  Persist the user's «запрос мастеру» (today `TD-ASK-MASTER`, not persisted) + add a `request` field to
  the check-in item (the 4 check-in/request states).
- **STATUS (2026-06-24): OPEN** — no conversation/message DTO or endpoint exists.
- **⟳ ENRICHED 2026-06-25 (master student-profile request-states — ex «item-3», precise contract).** The «запрос мастеру» must also surface on the MASTER's student profile (`MasterStudentProfileView`), not only as a chat thread. Verified now against `generated.ts`: (1) **No ask-master endpoint exists** — `BookingConfirmedView.onSendRequest` only fires a toast and **discards** the text (`TD-ASK-MASTER`); nothing is persisted. Need: persist it as **ONE request per booking, attached to that practice**, created from the booking-confirmed flow. (2) **The master cannot render it** — `StudentDetailResponse` (gen:966) / `StudentCheckinItem` (gen:959 = `{mood, comment, created_at}`) carry **no request field and no practice link**. Need the student-profile recent items to be **practice-keyed** so one row can carry check-in AND/OR request — e.g. add `request_text` + `practice_id` to `StudentCheckinItem`, or a parallel `recent_requests[]` on `StudentDetailResponse`. (3) Add the reviewer/student **`user_id`** (same gap as E1 gen:521/922 + E6) so a profile row can navigate to the student. **Frontend status:** until this lands, `MasterStudentProfileView` renders the **check-in state only** (real data); the request states are **deferred, not faked** (with the data contract undefined we render the real state, spec the contract here, and defer the dependent states rather than invent a shape or wire a POST to a non-existent endpoint).
- **⟳ 2026-06-30 (user «Сообщения» entry built — honest stub).** Profile ▸ «Аккаунт» now has a «Сообщения» row → `UserMessagesView` (route `user-messages`), an honest **empty-state** («Здесь появятся ваши переписки с мастерами» / «Функция в разработке») — **no fake threads**, no chat route, no send box. It is the swap point for the real conversations list once `GET /conversations` (above) lands; the profile-row unread badge stays OFF until `GET /conversations/unread-total` exists. **Known cleanup (deferred, F2=А):** `MasterMessagesView` / `MasterChatView` still render hardcoded fake conversations (pre-existing seed-only stub) — convert them to real data / honest empty-state when the API lands.

### E5 — Students / CRM aggregate. **P0.**
- **(a) Why.** "A master's students" — people who book/attend, aggregated per person.
- **(b) Screens.** Master dashboard → «Мои ученики»; `MasterStudentsView`; `MasterStudentProfileView`.
- **(c) Breaks.** Stubs; tap = «недоступно»; client-side search over a stub list.
- **(d) Backend.** No students aggregate.
- **Requests.** NEW `GET /masters/me/students`; NEW `GET /masters/me/students/{id}`.
- **STATUS (2026-06-24): DELIVERED** — `PaginatedStudentsResponse` (gen:671),
  `StudentListItem`(+needs_attention) (gen:984), `StudentDetailResponse` (gen:966); `getStudents`/
  `getStudent` masters.ts:120/130.

### E6 — Weekly AI summary (master + user). **P2.**
- **(a) Why.** A weekly personalised summary (insight + key feedbacks + who needs attention). The
  existing AI summary is per-practice and mock.
- **(b) Screens.** Master dashboard → «Саммари» + `MasterSummaryView`; user → «Подробнее» + `AiSummaryView`.
- **(c) Breaks.** Placeholder over no data.
- **(d) Backend.** `GET /practices/{id}/ai-summary` is mock + per-practice.
- **Requests.** NEW `GET /masters/me/weekly-summary`; NEW `GET /users/me/weekly-summary`. Each
  `key_feedbacks[]` / `needs_attention[]` item must carry a `student_id` (not just a name) so the
  summary cards can navigate to the student profile (`MasterSummaryView`).
- **STATUS (2026-06-24): OPEN** — only the per-practice `AISummaryResponse` (gen:33) exists; no
  weekly-summary endpoint. *(Frontend now renders «Требуют внимания» from the real `getStudents`
  feed + navigates; «Ключевые отзывы» stays non-navigable until a `student_id` / reviewer `user_id`
  lands — see E1.)*
- **LANE (2026-07-15):** OWNED-BY-NAV — not messaging/notifications, not Zod's under the narrowed lane.

### E7 — Period-scoped stats + deltas. **P1.**
- **(a) Why.** Master + admin dashboards show stat cards with a Неделя/Месяц toggle + a delta vs the
  previous period.
- **(b) Screens.** Master dashboard (cards + toggle), master analytics, admin dashboard.
- **(c) Breaks.** Master: only practices total real; participants/income/deltas stubbed. Admin: deltas/
  revenue/rates «—».
- **(d) Backend.** `AdminStatsResponse` was 4 bare counters; no master stats endpoint.
- **Requests.** EXTEND `GET /admin/stats` (deltas/revenue/rates/period); NEW `GET /masters/me/stats?period`.
- **STATUS (2026-06-24): DELIVERED** — master `MasterStatsResponse`(+deltas) (gen:526,
  `getMasterStats(period)` masters.ts:171); admin `AdminStatsOverviewResponse`(deltas/revenue/rates/
  period) (gen:113) + `/admin/metrics/{check-in,feedback,return}` + `AdminRevenueResponse` (gen:97).

### E8 — Notifications: contract + delivery. **P1 (contract) / P2 (delivery).**
- **(a) Why.** The master notifications screen exposes 9 types + a delivery schedule, but the contract
  carries only the four user keys. Push delivery itself is also unwired.
- **(b) Screens.** `MasterNotificationsView` (local-only); user `NotificationsView`; the dashboard bells.
- **(c) Breaks.** The master screen holds all state locally + does not persist; the bell has no feed.
- **(d) Backend.** `NotificationSettings`/`…Update` = exactly four keys (gen:551). No unread-feed.
- **Requests.** EXTEND with `new_booking, booking_cancelled, reminder, new_checkin, new_feedback,
  msg_participants, msg_support, ai_summary, monthly_report` + a `schedule{from,to,days}`; NEW push
  delivery + quiet-hours scheduler; NEW unread-feed for the bell.
- **STATUS (2026-06-28): PARTIAL ⬆ (was OPEN).** **DELIVERED:** the full master-notifications contract —
  `MasterNotificationSettings` (gen:486, 9 toggles) + `MasterNotificationSettingsUpdate` (gen:500) +
  `NotificationSchedule` (gen:579, `from_`/to/days) + `master_notifications` on `UserResponse` (gen:1118)
  & `UserUpdate` (gen:1138), persisted under credentials, gated by master **capability** (not role) incl.
  PATCH/POST (commits `7df02e7`/`e9fabb7`/`74ee56c`). User `NotificationSettings` correctly still 4 keys
  (gen:593). **OPEN:** push-delivery worker + quiet-hours scheduler runtime; unread bell-feed (no feed DTO).

### E9 — Admin oversight endpoints. **P0 (data) / P1 (rich).**
- **(a) Why.** The admin role is built to the design; most admin lists/details have no endpoint or a
  minimal one lacking the rich fields.
- **(b) Screens.** All admin screens.
- **(c) Breaks.** Lists honest-empty; rich fields «—»; withdrawal hero shows holder/«—»; 2FA is UI-only.
- **(d) Backend.** Mix of EXTEND + NEW (per item).
- **Requests.** EXTEND `/admin/masters/list`+`/{id}` (rich + application profile + docs[] + history +
  edit-fields + doc view/download; verify/reject already real); EXTEND `/admin/reports` (category/
  priority/date/reporter_name); EXTEND `/admin/users` (participants rich + filters); EXTEND
  `AdminWithdrawalResponse` (+master_display_name) + NEW real 2FA; NEW `/admin/metrics/*`; NEW
  `/admin/revenue`; NEW `/admin/practices`(+/{id}).
- **STATUS (2026-06-24): PARTIAL.** DELIVERED: `/admin/practices`(+/{id}) (gen:567/59), `/admin/revenue`
  (gen:97), `/admin/metrics/*`, verify/reject. **OPEN:** reports category/priority/reporter_name
  (`ReportResponse` gen:895 = reporter_id + status/target_type filters only); masters `/{id}` rich
  application profile + `documents[]` (returns minimal `AdminMasterListItem` gen:47) + edit-master-fields;
  `AdminWithdrawalResponse` (gen:141) `master_display_name` + real 2FA; participants rich fields + filters.
- **Q1 (batch Q, 2026-07-12) — admin masters LIST card rich fields.** `AdminMasterListItem` (gen:67)
  carries only id / name / avatar / role / `master_status` → the `AdminMastersView` cards render EVERY
  rich field as an honest «—» stub (**methods** · Практик/Учеников · К выводу [payout] · Опыт · Заявка
  [applied-at]). EXTEND the LIST response with these so the card fills in (the FE structure already
  consumes them). Priority field: add **`methods: list[str]`** (already stored in `data.profile.methods`)
  so the list card can show **направление + вид** via the batch-L `methodTaxonomy` parse — the SAME
  two-level readonly render now shipped on the master DETAIL (Q2, `AdminMasterReviewView`). Target = the
  operator's rich-card screenshot. ⚠ Adding fields to the list response → grep frozen key-sets in
  `backend/tests` first + regen `generated.ts`.
- **CLOSED-BY-NAV (batch R, 2026-07-14, LIVE c1dbe08) — E9-rich.** `AdminMasterListItem` rich card
  (methods + Практик/Ученики/К-выводу stats) delivered additively, self-built. Do not rebuild.
- **NEW `GET /admin/users/{id}` — admin single-user detail (ПРОМТ №372, 2026-07-12).** Today
  `/admin/users` (list) and `/admin/users/{id}/make-master` (action) exist, but there is no
  single-user GET. This blocks `AdminReportDetailView`'s clickable-target fix (master/practice
  targets already link out; `target_type=user` stays plain text — no user-detail screen to
  navigate to). **P2.**

### E10 — Promo module (verify-only). **P2.**
- **(a) Why.** Mostly already built; flagged so the small gap (a master's own list + delete) is closed.
- **(b) Screens.** `MasterPromocodesView` / `MasterNewPromocodeView`.
- **(c) Breaks.** Sample data + stubbed taps (frontend wrappers unwritten).
- **(d) Backend.** POST promos + `PaginatedPromosResponse` + `promo_code` on booking exist.
- **Request.** ADD `GET /masters/me/promos` (list) + `DELETE /masters/me/promos/{id}`.
- **STATUS (2026-07-01): DELIVERED + FRONTEND-WIRED (batch №227).** `POST` + **`GET /masters/me/promos`**
  (list_my_promos, router.py:72) + **`PATCH /masters/me/promos/{id}/deactivate`** (router.py:88) all exist;
  frontend wired (`api/promos.ts`, `MasterPromocodesView` active-list + soft-deactivate). A hard `DELETE`
  was NOT added (PATCH-deactivate covers it) — reopen only if a real hard-delete need surfaces.
- **CLOSED-BY-NAV (batch R, 2026-07-14, LIVE c1dbe08) — E10-promo.** Master-promo create crash fixed.
  Delete remains a soft-deactivate by design; no hard-delete endpoint is needed.

### E11 — One-offs.
- NEW master-side `DELETE` of a participant's booking (refund + notify) — `cancelBooking` is self-only. **P1.**
- NEW support-ticket intake `{ topic, message, attachments[] }` + upload (max 5 / 5 MB, server-side). **P1.**
- NEW connection-link auto-generation + delivery (~10 min pre-start). **P2.**
- NEW `DELETE /masters/me/payout` — only `PATCH` exists. **P2.** *(⟳ confirmed 2026-06-25, recon item #2 — `removePayout` is a stub toast «Удаление способа выплаты появится позже»; no delete endpoint, frontend does not fake a removal.)*
- NEW **card payout method** (card storage + one-time payout) — `savePayout` stubs `method==='card'` → toast «Выплата по номеру карты появится позже»; bank_transfer / PayPal / Revolut **already persist** via `PATCH /masters/me/payout`. So "doesn't save the card" = the card method only. ⟳ recon item #3 (2026-06-25). **P2.**
- EXTEND real account deletion + balance forfeiture. **P2.**
- EXTEND `UserResponse.email` (capture + expose). **P1.**
- **Master-application → profile data exposure (⟳ recon 2026-06-25, EditProfile).** (a) **`methods`** — onboarding
  captures the master's `methods` and the profile response carries a `methods?` field; the frontend renders
  locked method-chips gated on `profile.methods.length > 0` → VERIFY the backend COPIES the application's
  `methods` onto the profile, else the chips never render (recon item E2). (b) **application PHOTO** — there is
  **NO** `photo` / `photo_url` field anywhere in the contract (verified, grep); the profile avatar falls back to
  the Telegram `avatar_url`. To show an onboarding-captured photo, the application must capture + store a photo and
  expose it on the profile — contract undefined → define + spec (frontend defers, does not invent). **P2** (recon item E3).
- NEW i18n EN catalog + language render layer + date-format pref + formatter. **P2.**
- EXTEND `PracticeResponse` per-card `{ attended, no_show }` aggregate. **P2.**
- **STATUS (2026-07-04, email SELF-BUILT — PACK#3, ПРОМТ №280):** `UserResponse.email` capture+expose
  is DONE, additive credentials-JSONB (phone/bio pattern, NO column, NO migration): `"email"` added to
  `_JSONB_CREDENTIAL_FIELDS`, `UserResponse.email` computed_field, `UserUpdate.email` (soft
  email-validator; "" clears). `EditProfileView` email field enabled. Regenerated generated.ts.
  **ZOD HEADS-UP (Q1=А collision note):** Velo orc self-built this in `users/` (Zod's nominal E8 lane).
  It is **additive only** (one credentials key + one response field + one PATCH field) — no schema/
  column/migration, no conflict with E8's `master_notifications`. users/ was re-checked remote-cold at
  build (origin/main 0-ahead vs test, no in-flight users/ push). Reconcile-before-push still mandatory
  at deploy. The OTHER E11 one-offs below remain OPEN.
- **STATUS (2026-06-24): PARTIAL.** DELIVERED: real `DELETE /users/me` (forfeit) — users.ts:50.
  **OPEN:** master-delete-participant booking; support-ticket intake + upload; connection-link;
  `DELETE /masters/me/payout` (only PATCH); `UserResponse.email` (gen:1059 has none); per-card
  `{attended,no_show}` aggregate (data on `AttendanceResponse` gen:181); i18n EN (partly frontend).

### E12 — Check-in count aggregate (NEW post-audit). **P1.**
- **(a) Why.** Dashboard + practice cards show a «😊 N/M» check-in indicator.
- **(b) Screens.** Master dashboard cards; practice list/detail cards.
- **(c) Breaks.** No data source → the indicator can't render.
- **(d) Backend.** `checkin_count` is **absent** on `PracticeResponse` (gen:740) AND `PracticeSummary`
  (gen:775).
- **Request.** ADD `checkin_count` to the practice/list aggregate (groups with `recurrence_days` /
  `total_sessions` / `completed_sessions`, E3).
- **STATUS (2026-06-24): OPEN.** **LANE (2026-07-15):** OWNED-BY-NAV — see the SELF-FIX LOG
  REASSIGNED note above; same item, same reassignment.

### E13 — Master-application document upload (NEW post-audit). **P2.**
- **(a) Why.** The master-application flow shows document tiles, but there is no upload.
- **(b) Screens.** `MasterApplyView` (intake) + admin master-review (view/download — ties to E9 docs[]).
- **(c) Breaks.** `MasterApplyView` renders static placeholder tiles and always sends `documents: []`;
  no file input, no upload endpoint.
- **(d) Backend.** `MasterApplyRequest.documents` (gen:475) is a freeform JSON array in the apply body
  — no file-upload intake / storage. Ties to support-upload (E11) / E4 attachments.
- **Request.** NEW document upload intake + storage; surface on the admin master-review (E9 docs[]).
- **EXTEND (slice-2 2026-06-27):** the redesigned Step-3 also adds a **profile photo** (public) upload
  — no `photo_url` on `MasterProfileResponse` (gen:486). Build the UI (drop-zone + uploaded-chip),
  tap = honest «недоступно» until storage ships. Add `photo_url` intake on apply + surface on profile.
- **STATUS (2026-06-24): OPEN — Zod (exception to the 2026-07-15 lane rule — see below). P2.**
- **REASSIGNED (operator exception, 2026-07-15):** back to Zod, but NOT because document upload is his
  kind of feature — it is not messaging/notifications, and under the lane rule above would otherwise
  stay OWNED-BY-NAV. It is Zod's because its blocker is infrastructure he owns and has not yet built:
  **S3 is not connected, and there is no file storage anywhere in this project.** Revisit if storage
  ever lands independently of Zod's build.

### E14 — Master-application rejection reason, surfaced (NEW post-audit). **P2.**
- **(a) Why.** A rejected applicant should see *why* (`MasterPendingView` shows a hardcoded «Причина: …»).
- **(b) Screens.** `MasterPendingView`.
- **(c) Breaks.** No `rejection_reason` on any DTO the applicant can read.
- **(d) Backend.** `RejectMasterRequest.reason` (gen:885) is admin **input** only; it is **not exposed**
  on `MasterProfileResponse` (gen:486) / `MasterApplyResponse`.
- **Request.** Surface `rejection_reason` on the applicant-readable profile/apply response.
- **EXTEND (slice-2 2026-06-27):** the redesigned «Отказ» screen renders the specific reason + keeps a
  «Подать новую заявку» path (operator fork-4=Б). Confirm a rejected applicant's role/status keeps the
  rejected screen REACHABLE and the re-apply path allowed after rejection.
- **STATUS (2026-07-01): SELF-FIXED (batch №227) — see SELF-FIX LOG.** `rejection_reason` projected onto
  `MasterProfileResponse` from `data.account.rejection_reason`; `MasterPendingView` renders the real reason.
- **CLOSED-BY-NAV (batch R, 2026-07-14 + follow-up 2026-07-15, LIVE) — E14-reject.**
  `rejection_reason` had ALREADY shipped (see above; re-verified 2026-07-15 at
  `backend/app/modules/users/router.py:63-73` → `MasterPendingView.vue:131,145` -- genuinely reaches
  the frontend, not a doc-trust claim). R2 (batch R, `cb6d8bf`, 2026-07-14) fixed a real
  `masterPendingGuard` gap — but that was NOT the whole bug, as the operator's own device testing
  found on 2026-07-15: R2 only ALLOWED a rejected applicant onto `/master/pending` if they reached it;
  nothing actually ROUTED them there. A returning rejected applicant (different session, 24-48h later)
  landed on `/user/dashboard` and never saw the screen the guard now permitted. Closed 2026-07-15:
  `roleRedirect` now routes a rejected, not-yet-seen applicant to `/master/pending` once (operator
  decision: show the verdict, then treat them as an ordinary user). Nothing owed to Zod — both gaps
  were frontend-only.

### E15 — Master-onboarding "completed" flag (NEW 2026-06-26). **P2.**
- **(a) Why.** A freshly-verified master currently lands straight on `MasterDashboardView` with no intro.
  We are building a one-time master-onboarding carousel (clone of the user `OnboardingView` pattern). It
  must show ONCE, cross-device — so it needs its OWN persisted flag, distinct from `onboarding_completed`
  (which is already `true` by the time a user becomes a master, so it cannot be reused).
- **(b) Screens.** new master `OnboardingView` (master-flavored), gated in `App.vue`/router on first
  master-dashboard entry after verification.
- **(c) Breaks.** No `master_onboarding_completed` field exists on `UserResponse` (gen:1072 has only
  `onboarding_completed`), and the PATCH-self endpoint does not accept/persist it. Frontend is built
  defensively (absent field → treat as not-completed → show once); persistence + gate go live on delivery.
- **(d) Backend.** Mirror the existing `onboarding_completed`: add `master_onboarding_completed: boolean`
  to `UserResponse`; accept `{ master_onboarding_completed: true }` on the user self-update PATCH (same
  path the user carousel uses to persist `{ timezone, onboarding_completed: true }`); store in the same
  credentials JSONB.
- **Request.** Add the field to `UserResponse` + accept it on PATCH-self, mirroring `onboarding_completed`.
- **STATUS (2026-06-26): OPEN.** (Frontend built against it under build-full-design; deploy gate with the batch.)
- **LANE (2026-07-15):** OWNED-BY-NAV — see the SELF-FIX LOG REASSIGNED note above; same item.

### E16 — Master-application "languages" field (NEW slice-2 2026-06-27). **P2.**
- **(a) Why.** The redesigned Step-2 «Опыт» adds a «Язык проведения практик» control (Русский /
  English). Operator fork-3=А: build the full UI now, persist later.
- **(b) Screens.** `MasterApplyView` step 2; later the public/admin master profile.
- **(c) Breaks.** `MasterApplyExperience` / `MasterApplyRequest` (gen:472) has no `languages` field;
  `MasterProfileResponse` (gen:486) has no `languages`. The control persists nothing until added.
- **Request.** Add `languages: string[]` to the apply experience intake + surface on the profile.
- **STATUS (2026-07-04): SELF-BUILT (PACK#3, ПРОМТ №280).** Additive JSONB `data.profile.languages`
  (mirror `methods`, NO migration): `MasterApplyExperience.languages` (default []) + on
  `MasterProfileResponse`; apply UI wired (`langRu`/`langEn` → experience.languages). Q2=А: FREELY
  editable on the profile (no moderation) via new `PATCH /api/v1/masters/me/languages` +
  `EditProfileView` languages chips. Regenerated generated.ts. HELD (accumulate-then-deploy).

### E17 — Master web auth (Phase A) (NEW slice-3 2026-06-27). **P3 (future web build).**
- **(a) Why.** The Figma Phase A is a standalone WEB master portal: Landing / Login (email+password) /
  Recover-password (request + set-new). The Telegram Mini App authenticates via `initData` and has NO
  password concept, so Phase A has no place in the Telegram flow. Built now as PARKED, INERT screens
  (unlinked `/auth/*` routes, no fake auth) so they exist in the project and wait for the web build.
- **(b) Screens.** new `views/auth/{Landing,Login,RecoverPasswordRequest,RecoverPasswordSet}View.vue`.
- **(c) Breaks.** No email/password auth surface exists: no register/login-by-password endpoint, no
  password hashing/sessions, no password-reset email flow. The current only auth is `/auth/telegram`
  (initData). The parked screens render fields but submit is a no-op / «недоступно».
- **Request.** When the standalone web build is real: email/password registration + login + session +
  password-reset email. Wire the parked `/auth/*` screens to it. Entirely a future web-build concern.
- **STATUS (2026-06-27): OPEN — PARKED.** (Frontend inert screens built; not wired; no Telegram impact.)
- **LANE (2026-07-15):** OWNED-BY-NAV when unparked — not messaging/notifications. Stays parked/P3;
  no urgency, recorded only so it isn't mis-assigned to Zod if it ever moves.

### E18 — Zoom link on `PracticeSummary` (NEW 2026-07-01). **P2.**
- **(a) Why.** The user «Ближайшая практика» (dashboard) + «Мои бронирования» booking cards have a Zoom
  button. The booking object (`BookingWithPracticeResponse.practice`) embeds a `PracticeSummary`, which
  has NO `zoom_link` — so the button cannot open the meeting without a second round-trip.
- **(b) Screens.** `UserDashboardView` (Zoom button); `MyBookingsView` / booking cards.
- **(c) Breaks.** `UserDashboardView.onZoomClick` is an honest stub (toast «Ссылка появится ближе к
  началу») — we deliberately do NOT fire a per-click `GET /practices/{id}` just to read the link. (The
  in-session `PracticeLiveView` already opens the real link — it fetches the full `PracticeResponse`.)
- **(d) Backend.** `zoom_link` exists on `PracticeResponse` (gen:799) but is **absent** on
  `PracticeSummary` (gen:775 — the same object that lacks `checkin_count`, E12).
- **Request.** ADD `zoom_link` to `PracticeSummary` so booking cards can open Zoom without a separate GET;
  then wire `platform.openLink(...)` on the user dashboard (master screens already open it via the full
  `PracticeResponse`).
- **STATUS (2026-07-01): SELF-FIXED (batch №227) — see SELF-FIX LOG.** `zoom_link` added to `PracticeSummary` (from_attributes, no migration) + `generated.ts` + Zoom wired. No Zod action.

### E19 — Master methods change-request workflow (NEW 2026-07-01, operator PE-3). **P2.**
- **(a) Why.** On the master «Редактировать профиль» screen the operator wants the onboarding methods shown,
  LOCKED, and changeable only via an admin-approved request. The operator's mockup (PE-3, image 2 — the
  design spec) shows a **two-level taxonomy** «Направление» (direction, e.g. Йога) → «Вид» (kind, e.g.
  Хатха) per method, each editable via a pencil → inline edit → auto-submitted change request → a
  **«Ожидает подтверждения»** (pending) badge until an admin approves, with the note «Изменение направления
  или вида практики требует подтверждения администратора. Запрос отправляется автоматически. Обработка
  запроса обычно занимает не более 3 рабочих дней.»
- **(b) Screens.** `EditProfileView` (master variant) methods block; an admin approve/reject surface.
- **(c) Breaks.** The current data is a **flat `string[]`** — `MasterProfileResponse.methods` (fed from the
  apply `AVAILABLE_METHODS`, e.g. "Йога","Медитация"). There is NO Направление→Вид (direction→kind) pairing,
  NO method-change-request entity, NO pending/approval status. None of the mockup's structure or workflow
  exists. **Frontend today ships the honest locked flat-chip display** (`EditProfileView` §methods:
  read-only `VChip`s + «Изменить методы можно через поддержку»); it does NOT fake the taxonomy or the
  pending state (no-fake rule).
- **(d) Backend.** Needs: (1) a two-level methods model — each method = { direction, kind } instead of a
  flat string; surface it on `MasterProfileResponse`. (2) A method-change-request endpoint (master submits a
  proposed direction/kind edit). (3) An admin approval/rejection workflow. (4) A per-method **pending**
  status the profile response exposes so the frontend can render «Ожидает подтверждения» until resolved.
- **Request.** Design + build the taxonomy model + change-request + admin-approval + pending status; image 2
  (PE-3) is the visual spec. Then the frontend upgrades the locked flat-chip display into the mockup's
  editable-with-approval rows. Until then the honest locked display stands.
- **STATUS (2026-07-04): SELF-BUILT FLAT (M3, ПРОМТ №278) — two-level taxonomy DEFERRED / out of scope.**
  Operator locked F-M3-1=А (FLAT `string[]`, no direction→kind nesting) after recon surfaced that this E19
  entry contradicted the flat decision. Shipped additively (no migration): JSONB
  `data.profile.method_change_request` + 4 endpoints mirroring the master-application verify/reject loop
  — `POST /masters/me/method-change-request` (master submit), `GET /admin/masters/method-change-requests`
  (admin list-pending), `POST /admin/masters/{id}/method-change-request/approve|reject`. Exposed on
  `MasterProfileResponse.method_change_request` (optional). Frontend: `EditProfileView` master methods block
  upgraded from locked-chips to an editable flat set + «Ожидает подтверждения» pending badge + auto-submit
  note; new admin `AdminMethodRequestsView` moderation screen. The **two-level Направление→Вид taxonomy**
  from the operator's PE-3 mockup (per-method pencil-edit, per-method pending) remains **OPEN / deferred** —
  revisit if the operator re-prioritises the nested design.

## C) CROSS-ZONE DEDUP NOTES

- **E1** = ONE endpoint serving three master screens. The cross-practice needs-attention feed is the
  same E1 work (do not build a separate "#3").
- **E2 (income/ledger) ≡ E9 admin revenue** — same ledger layer. *(Both DELIVERED.)*
- **E4 (messaging)** = ONE module: master ↔ participant + admin → user + user → master + support thread.
- **E7 (period stats)** — master `/masters/me/stats` and admin `/admin/stats` = the same period-summary
  contract. *(Both DELIVERED.)*
- **email** — on the apply profile; two exposure points: `UserResponse` (E11) + admin master-review (E9).
- **connection-link** — master Create «Подключение» + user dashboard "Zoom недоступен" = same backend.
- **documents** — E13 upload intake feeds the E9 admin master-review `documents[]` view/download.

## D) NOT A ZOD TASK (frontend-only — do NOT build)

- **E1 per-practice `attention` filter — frontend-wiring, not backend.** The backend filter EXISTS on
  `GET /practices/{id}/reviews` (test-verified, `test_reviews_attention_filter` passes); the frontend
  wrapper `getPracticeReviews` (practices.ts) just doesn't pass it. Do NOT rebuild it. *(The genuine
  backend gap is the cross-practice **filter param** on `/masters/me/reviews` — see E1 STATUS.)*
- **Promo wiring** — the backend POST/list DTOs exist (E10); the `api/promos.ts` GET/DELETE wrappers +
  view connection are frontend. **Stale as written — corrected (2026-07-15):** `GET /masters/me/promos`
  was already delivered by Zod and is frontend-wired (see E10 STATUS); the `DELETE` was deliberately
  NOT built (PATCH-deactivate covers it, per the E10-promo CLOSED-BY-NAV note). Nothing left here for
  anyone — not a live task, Zod's or ours.
- **E2 income attribution** — income/transactions are consumed by `AnalyticsView`, NOT
  `MasterFinanceView` (Finance = payout/withdrawal). Frontend-coordination note, no backend change.
- **Currency ₽ / €, SHELL debts, standalone top-up entry, withdrawal «Выплаты» list (option Б over the
  existing `GET /admin/withdrawals`)** — frontend / operator product decisions, no new backend.

## Delivered OUTSIDE the E-epic set (not E-numbered — recorded for coordination)

- **Auto-complete practice by duration (prod-critical lifecycle worker) — DELIVERED.** The backend
  autofinalize worker transitions `scheduled`/`live` → `completed` on `scheduled_at + duration`,
  resolves attendance, and releases frozen funds (autofinalize.py present + enabled). Not in
  `generated.ts` because it is a worker, not an endpoint. *(Was a round-2/3 prod-critical add, not an
  original epic.)*
  - **⟳ VERIFY 2026-06-25 (recon item 4).** On TEST a past-dated practice (e.g. 16 июня, today the 19th)
    still shows `scheduled` and stays in the master's «Предстоящие» (the list filters by status only, no
    date guard; «Прошедшие» is `completed`-only). Since the worker is DELIVERED, this is likely either
    the autofinalize worker not enabled/running on TEST, or a seed artifact (a practice seeded as
    `scheduled` with a past `scheduled_at`, which the worker may not retroactively finalize). Please
    verify the worker is enabled on TEST and finalizes already-past practices (or fix the seed). Per the
    environment note above this may be a seed/env gap, not a contract gap — the frontend deliberately
    ships no hack that would hide a non-completed practice from both tabs.
- **#1 (self-fix, NOT Zod):** `StudentDetailResponse.name` + `avatar_url` added (deployed).
- **#2 (self-fix, NOT Zod):** `test_admin_metrics.py` made seed-tolerant (test-isolation, not a contract
  bug). Optional follow-up (LANE 2026-07-15: OWNED-BY-NAV, not messaging/notifications): harden
  `conftest` isolation (transactional rollback / clean DB).

**Summary (actualized 2026-06-28 vs live `origin/test=4713c60`).** Epics E1–E11 + new E12–E17. Of E1–E11:
E1/E2/E5/E7 DELIVERED; E9 core delivered (rich remainder open); E3/E8/E10/E11 PARTIAL; E4/E6 OPEN.
E12–E17 OPEN (E17 PARKED — master web-auth, future web build). **Only delta since 2026-06-24: E8 OPEN →
PARTIAL** (master-notifications contract + capability gate delivered; push/feed open). No regression.
Auto-complete-by-duration + W-6/W-7 (user dashboard) delivered outside the epic set. This is the current
state to hand to Zod against his own numbering.

## 2026-07-03 — ROLE_SWITCH_ENABLED removed (heads-up for YOUR docs)

**What changed (commit `15d5b0d`, held batch on `d01f6f9`, ПРОМТ №256):** the TEST-only
`ROLE_SWITCH_ENABLED` flag is REMOVED entirely (config field, the 404 router gate on
`POST /users/me/role`, the W-4 startup warning + its test file, and the seeded
`credentials.role_switch.allowed_roles` allow-lists — now ignored). Role-switch security is
capability-derived (`derive_allowed_roles` in `app/modules/users/schemas.py`, single source of
truth for the write path AND the `role_switch` block in `GET /users/me`): USER always ·
+MASTER with a verified MasterProfile · admin keeps all three via a server-written
`credentials.role_switch.home_role` round-trip marker; a non-admin can NEVER switch to admin
(CLI `velo setrole` only). The endpoint is always on; a plain user derives `{USER}` and can do
nothing. `ROLE_SWITCH_ENABLED=False` in the TEST `.env` is inert and can be dropped.

**Stale references left in YOUR docs (we don't edit them — please align on your next pass):**
- `VELO-Backend.md:36` — W-4 summary line («громкий security-WARNING при `role_switch_enabled=True`») — the flag and the warning no longer exist.
- `VELO-Backend.md:1202` — same W-4 warning note.
- `VELO-Backend.md:1244` — «эндпоинт 404 в проде при `role_switch_enabled=False`» — the 404 gate is gone; security = derived policy.
- `VELO-Technical-Specification.md:2726` — W-4 checklist entry.
- `VELO-Technical-Specification.md:3146` — W-4 mention in the hardening summary list.

**Optional one-line follow-up in YOUR `set_role.py`:** demoting an admin (→user/master) while
they are role-switched away leaves a stale `credentials.role_switch.home_role="admin"` marker
(they could self-return to admin via the switch). Clearing the marker in your demote path
closes the edge; operator accepted the edge as-is for now (№257 ruling), so this is optional.

## 2026-07-03 — zoom_link exposure matrix: test-debt cells (tied to your E18/M-3/Z-6/Z-7 batch)

Pre-push audit (ПРОМТ №262) mapped `test_zoom_link_visibility.py` onto the full exposure matrix.
The gate itself verified fail-closed (only the two builders set the field). Six cells have NO test —
small additive cases, your file/conventions:

1. `GET /bookings/{id}` — the booking-detail response wipes zoom_link via
   `model_copy(update={"zoom_link": None})` (bookings/router.py:281) — untested.
2. Finalize response — same wipe at bookings/router.py:392-395 — untested.
3. Practice detail for an ATTENDED booking — only CONFIRMED is asserted today
   (test_detail_zoom_link_gated_by_booking); the ATTENDED branch of
   ZOOM_VISIBLE_BOOKING_STATUSES on the DETAIL surface is uncovered.
4. NO_SHOW booking — not asserted on any surface (should be None everywhere).
5. Public catalog list (`GET /practices`) for a user who HAS a confirmed booking —
   the list is unconditionally None even for eligible users (list builder never
   passes visibility); asserting that pins the design.
6. Admin surfaces — zoom_link is structurally absent from all admin serializers
   (grep-verified); one assert would guard against a future admin schema gaining it.

Note: we added the owner-mutation-response cells ourselves in №263
(`test_owner_create_response_shows_zoom_link` / `test_owner_update_response_shows_zoom_link`)
after making the four owner-only CRUD responses in practices/router.py pass
`zoom_link_visible=True` (F1) — consistent with your Z-6 owner-always-sees rule.

## 2026-07-03 — U4 no-show reflection: persist endpoint + booking flag (frontend shipped on a stub, ПРОМТ №269)

The User frontend now has a full **no-show reflection** flow, built entirely on a
**stub** (no backend calls). A booking with `status = no_show` («Не состоялась») now shows
a dashboard banner → `/user/reflection/:practiceId` → `ReflectionView` (FormShell, comment
only, NO rating) → submit. The submit path is a client no-op
(`diaryStore.submitReflection`, `TD-REFLECTION`) that resolves ok and dismisses the banner
**client-side for the session only** (`bookingsStore.dismissedReflections`, mirrors the
existing `dismissedCheckins`). Nothing persists yet. Please wire the backend to make it real:

**1. Persist endpoint — mirror the feedback endpoint shape.**
- `POST /api/v1/practices/{practice_id}/reflection` — body `{ "comment": string | null }`
  (NO rating — a no-show reflection does not rate the practice).
- Upsert semantics, one per `(practice, user)`, like feedback.
- **Eligibility (mirror the feedback gate, inverted status):** `booking.status == no_show`,
  within the window `scheduled_at + duration_minutes .. + 72h`
  (`FEEDBACK_WINDOW_H`, identical to feedback — frontend uses `isInFeedbackWindow`).
- Response can mirror `FeedbackResponse` (a `ReflectionResponse` sibling); the frontend does
  not yet read the response body, so its exact shape is your call.
- May project a diary-feed event (like feedback/check-in) — optional; the frontend does not
  depend on it for the stub.

**2. Booking flag — `has_reflection: bool` on `BookingWithPracticeResponse`.**
- Mirror `has_feedback`: `true` once the user has submitted a reflection for that booking.
- This **replaces** the client-only session dismiss. When the field ships, the frontend will
  switch the dashboard `reflectionAlert` computed from `dismissedReflections.includes(...)`
  to `!b.has_reflection` (one-line swap, symmetrical to `feedbackAlert` reading
  `has_feedback`), and `generated.ts` regenerates then (NOT now — the stub adds no types).

**⚠ DEPLOY-GATE WARNING (has burned us before):** adding `has_reflection` to
`BookingWithPracticeResponse` grows the response key-set. **Before** you add the field,
`grep backend/tests` for frozen **exact-key-set** assertions on the bookings serializers
(e.g. `assert set(data.keys()) == {...}`) and update them in the same commit — the local
pre-push gate skips pytest, so a stale key-set only fails at deploy, not locally.

**Frontend wiring already in place (nothing for you to touch there):**
`utils/reflectionVariants.ts` (copy pool, stable per practiceId), `ReflectionView.vue`,
`stores/diary.ts::submitReflection` (the stub to flip to a real `upsertReflection` call),
`stores/bookings.ts::dismissedReflections`, dashboard `reflectionAlert` + banner, route
`user-reflection`. `generated.ts` UNTOUCHED by the frontend batch.

### E20 — Admin-editable catalog (directions / practice types / methods). **P2. STATUS: OWNED-BY-NAV (navigator tail T2) — NOT Zod's lane. Do not start.**

**(a) Why.** Today the taxonomy is code-frozen: adding a practice **direction**, a **practice
type**, or a master **method** requires a code edit + redeploy (see `core/config.py:112`,
`docs/seed-context.md:208-212`). The operator wants an **admin catalog section** to add / edit /
remove entries at runtime — WITHOUT a heavy relational join-table redesign (operator decision **Б:
config-driven editable catalog, grandfather existing data**).

**(b) Screens.** A new admin **«Каталог»** editor (three lists: Направления / Виды практик /
Методы, each with add-edit-remove); the picklists it feeds — `CreatePracticeView`/`EditPracticeView`
(direction + type), `MasterApplyView`/`EditProfileView` (methods).

**(c) What exists today (all code-level constants, NONE are tables — recon ПРОМТ №314):**
- **Directions:** Python `PracticeDirection(StrEnum)` `practices/models.py:67-88` + runtime allow-list
  `settings.practice_allowed_directions` `core/config.py:139`; stored per-practice in JSONB
  `data.taxonomy.direction` (not a column). FE mirrors: `utils/practiceOptions.ts` `DIRECTION_OPTIONS`,
  `utils/displayHelpers.ts` `DIRECTION_LABEL`, `api/types.ts` `PracticeDirection`.
- **Practice types:** Python `PracticeType(StrEnum)` `practices/models.py:43-53` + allow-list
  `settings.practice_allowed_types` `core/config.py:113`; persisted as a validated `String(20)` column.
- **Methods:** free `list[ShortStr]` (1–200 chars, **no catalog enforcement**) `masters/schemas.py:63`,
  stored JSONB `data.profile.methods`. The only "catalog" is a **frontend-only** const
  `utils/methods.ts` (6 RU strings) — the backend accepts arbitrary strings today.

**(d) Backend — decision Б (config-driven, minimal migration). SUPERSEDED 2026-07-14 by the
operator's R5 Decision 1 = А: TWO FK-linked tables (`practice_directions` + `practice_styles`), on the
grounds that a style is never nested deeper than one level under a direction, so the tree-shaped
`catalog_entries` design below is overkill. The live schema (seed + admin CRUD + read endpoint +
editable admin UI + auto-promote-with-confirm) shipped in batch R, LIVE at c1dbe08 — see the
CLOSED-BY-NAV note at the end of this epic. Building `catalog_entries` now would add a THIRD schema
on top of the two already live. The (d.1)-(d.4) text below is kept as historical record, not a live
spec:**
1. **Catalog store.** A single persisted, admin-mutable catalog for the three lists — a small
   `catalog_entries` table (`kind ∈ {direction, practice_type, method}`, `value`, `label`,
   `active`, `sort`) **or** a JSONB config row — seeded from the current enum / settings values so
   day-one behaviour is identical. No per-practice/per-master data migration.
2. **Rewire the validators** that currently read `settings.practice_allowed_directions` /
   `_types` (`practices/schemas.py:290,466`, `practices/router.py:100`) to read the catalog store
   instead. **⚠ Collision flag: CLEARED (2026-07-15) — the lane is OWNED-BY-NAV (T2), not Zod's, so
   two agents will not be in these validators at once;** `practices/schemas.py:290,466` and
   `practices/router.py:100` are T2's working surface, same as (d.1)-(d.4) above. The underlying
   technical risk stands regardless of who holds the lane: these validators gate practice creation —
   changing their source is load-bearing; a bad catalog row would reject valid `POST /practices`.
3. **CRUD + admin auth.** `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /admin/catalog/{kind}` (+ the FE editor screen).
4. **Grandfather / soft enforcement (operator Б):** existing master free-text `methods` stay VALID;
   the catalog drives the **picklist for NEW selections only**; the backend still ACCEPTS
   already-stored off-catalog values (no forced migration, no hard "catalog-only" rejection).
   Strict enforcement (reject off-catalog) = a **later toggle**, not now.

**(e) Notes.** Removing a catalog entry must NOT orphan practices/masters already using it (soft
delete / `active=false` so historical rows still render their label). Directions additionally carry a
FE icon map (`DIRECTION_ICON`, Partial+fallback) — a new direction with no icon falls back gracefully
(`TD-CAL-DIRECTIONS-EXPAND`), so the catalog can add directions ahead of icons. This epic supersedes
the "manual code edit + migration" note in `docs/seed-context.md:208-212` once shipped.

**(f) Deep-scout confirmation (ПРОМТ №360) + FE read-only ALREADY SHIPPED (batch P).**
Forensic re-verify of the self-vs-Zod hinge — all confirmed:
- The `PracticeDirection` enum is **NOT a gate**: it appears only as docstring/typing mirror
  (`practices/models.py:14,67,75`, `core/config.py:137`) — never a DB column type, `server_default`,
  CHECK, or `PracticeDirection(v)` coercion. Direction is stored as JSONB `data.taxonomy.direction`
  (schema-on-read `@property`, `models.py:201`). New directions store/validate without touching the enum.
- Validation is **soft, per-request**: `v not in settings.practice_allowed_directions /
  _styles_by_direction` inside per-request validators (`schemas.py:290,466,114`, `router.py:100`,
  `_flat_allowed_styles` `schemas.py:84`) — read at REQUEST time, so the read SOURCE can be swapped.
- **No config/settings/kv store exists** (migrations are all domain tables) → a migration is unavoidable.
  **⚠ Historical claim, since overtaken — see below:** this was true when written (ПРОМТ №360); a
  store now exists (batch R). Kept for context, not as a live statement.
- **T2 scope (navigator, was "Minimal Zod scope" — re-headed 2026-07-15, each part re-verified against
  current code before carrying forward):**
  1. ~~store = 1 migration~~ — **DEAD, already live.** The store this item asked for already exists:
     `practice_directions` + `practice_styles` (batch R migration
     `2026_07_14_1a2b3c4d5e6f_create_practice_taxonomy_tables.py`, LIVE c1dbe08), seeded with values
     matching the `PracticeDirection` enum exactly (`meditation`, `yoga`, …) — table names and seed
     values confirm it was built as the shared taxonomy store, not a methods-only table. T2 does not
     create anything here; it points the practice-creation side at what already exists.
  2. **endpoints — mostly already exist, verify scope not build fresh.** `GET /api/v1/taxonomy`
     (public/master read) and `GET/POST/PATCH /api/v1/admin/taxonomy/*` (admin CRUD) already exist
     (R5) on the SAME tables. T2's work here is confirming these already cover the direction+style
     axis for practice-creation, not standing up `GET /catalog` from scratch.
  3. **validation source-swap — VERIFIED STILL OPEN (2026-07-15).** Checked current code:
     `practices/schemas.py:286-289` and `:463-467` (`direction_must_be_valid`) and
     `practices/router.py:97-105` (`_validate_directions`) still read `settings.practice_allowed_directions`
     directly — none have been rewired to the taxonomy tables. This part is real, unstarted work.
     ⚠ Load-bearing: these validators gate `POST /practices`; a bad read source rejects valid creates.
  4. **FE async-fetch — VERIFIED STILL OPEN (2026-07-15).** Checked current code: `CreatePracticeView.vue`
     does not call `getActiveTaxonomy` (`api/taxonomy.ts`); `utils/practiceOptions.ts:170`
     (`DIRECTION_OPTIONS`) is still a hardcoded const. This part is real, unstarted work.
  - **Scope caveat, not covered by (1)-(4) above:** the taxonomy tables only cover the
    direction+style axis. `PracticeType` (session **format** — a separate axis, validated in
    `router.py`'s `_validate_types`, persisted as a real `String(20)` column, see (c) above) has NO
    table and NO seed at all — closing (2)-(4) does not close the `practice_type` half of this epic.
- **FE read-only ALREADY SHIPPED (batch P, this session):** `admin-catalog` route + `AdminCatalogView.vue`
  (read-only list of directions→styles from `practiceOptions`, honest "редактирование появится с бэкендом
  каталога" note, NO dead controls) + a «Каталог практик» dashboard row. Taxonomy is built in one
  `buildCatalog()` = the **single swap point**: when `GET /catalog` lands, point it at the endpoint and
  the UI renders unchanged. **Stale as written — corrected (2026-07-15):** batch R already delivered
  exactly this for the master-**methods** side (editable controls + persistence, DB-backed, LIVE
  c1dbe08 — see the CLOSED-BY-NAV note immediately below). Only the practice-creation side
  (directions/types, this `GET /catalog` swap point) remains, and it is navigator tail T2, not Zod's.
- **CLOSED-BY-NAV (batch R, 2026-07-14, LIVE c1dbe08) — E20-catalog, MASTER-METHODS SCOPE ONLY.**
  DB-backed taxonomy self-built: 2 tables (directions/styles) + seed + admin CRUD + read endpoint +
  picker consuming it + editable admin UI + custom-method auto-promote with admin confirmation. Scope
  is master **methods** only — **practice-creation taxonomy (directions/types, (b)/(d) above) still
  runs on the old code-level config and remains OPEN — planned SELF (navigator tail T2, batch R
  follow-up) — NOT Zod's lane.** Do not rebuild the methods side.

### E21 — Zoom attendance tracking (NEW 2026-07-12, operator). **P0. DEADLINE 2026-07-17.**
- **(a) Why.** Attendance today is inferred by the clock-driven lifecycle (Zod's recent
  `feat(practices)!: drive practice lifecycle by the clock` — a scheduled practice auto-finalizes on
  schedule and currently ASSUMES every booked participant attended). The operator wants REAL per-meeting
  attendance from Zoom itself (join/leave events), replacing the assumption with ground truth.
- **(b) Screens/consumers (FE, after the contract lands).** Nothing to build FE-side yet — this is a
  pure backend/data epic. Once shipped, existing FE surfaces that already display attendance-derived
  data become live instead of clock-inferred: master analytics hours/practices-attended counts,
  the user dashboard check-in/feedback-vs-reflection branching, the diary состоялась/не-состоялась
  indicator on past entries.
- **(c) What's needed.**
  1. Zoom webhook/API integration: capture `meeting.participant_joined` / `meeting.participant_left`
     (or equivalent) per scheduled practice's Zoom meeting.
  2. Map Zoom participant identity → the platform's booking/user record for that practice (join by
     email/display-name-token or a pre-generated per-booking join link — TBD, needs a Zoom-side
     identification strategy).
  3. Derive a real attended/no_show verdict per booking from the join/leave timeline against a
     duration threshold (e.g. "present for ≥N% of the scheduled duration" — **threshold value TBD**,
     operator to confirm).
  4. Feed the verdict into `booking.status` at finalize time, REPLACING the current clock-driven
     "assume attended" default (the lifecycle-by-clock auto-finalizer becomes the fallback only when
     Zoom data is unavailable, not the primary source).
- **(d) Downstream (what starts being REAL once this ships, not before):** hours-practiced count ·
  practices-attended count · feedback-request branching (attended → feedback prompt / no_show →
  reflection prompt) · diary "состоялась / не состоялась" indicator on past entries. **FE does not
  build speculative UI for this now** — the existing surfaces already render whatever `booking.status`
  says (clock-inferred today); they pick up the real signal automatically once this epic changes what
  populates that field. No FE ticket needed until the contract (exact field/enum) is defined.
- **STATUS: OPEN — Zod. Deadline 2026-07-17 (operator-set). Lane confirmed by operator 2026-07-15
  (stays Zod's despite the 2026-07-15 lane policy — attendance rides his module).**

## 2026-07-07 — admin «Revoke master» self-added (heads-up for YOUR role lane, A1)

**Self-built (additive, JSONB, NO migration) — do not rebuild, avoid colliding in the role/auth
lane.** New admin endpoints mirror CLI `scripts/set_role.py to_user` **exactly** so the two stay one
behavior:
- `POST /api/v1/admin/masters/{user_id}/revoke` — soft-freeze: `User.role -> user` (only if currently
  master) + clear the switched-away-admin marker (`credentials_without_admin_home`, R-1); profile
  `data.account.status -> "suspended"`, `data.availability.is_accepting -> False`. **Every row is
  preserved** (no delete). Capability keys on `status=="verified"` (`users/service.user_has_master_
  capability`), so suspending drops it → the account logs in user-only.
- `GET /api/v1/admin/masters/{user_id}/revoke-preview` → `RevokeMasterAdvisory` (future scheduled/live
  practices, balance, pending withdrawals). Operator decision **Б: WARN-not-block** — the CLI's
  downgrade guard is surfaced as advisory only; the revoke never blocks.
- **Re-grant** reuses the EXISTING `make_master` re-verify branch (`admin/users/service.py:282-296`,
  the "Сделать мастером" button): a `suspended` profile → `status="verified"` + `role=master`, data
  intact. Verified end-to-end; no change needed there.

If you add a durable revoke/suspension concept later, reconcile with this JSONB soft-freeze so CLI +
admin + your path agree on `status=="suspended"` as the parked state.

## 2026-07-07 — admin F-batch backend-blocked items (F2/F6, F4) — REASSIGNED OWNED-BY-NAV 2026-07-15

The admin F-batch shipped its self/FE parts (F1/F5/F3 masters status filter, F7 moderation reset).
Two items were backend-blocked and originally deferred to Zod; both are OWNED-BY-NAV now (2026-07-15
lane policy — neither is messaging/notifications). Recorded here, historical heading kept for context.

### F2/F6 — master card + detail must show «Направление» + «Вид» — FOLD into E19 + E20. **P2. STATUS: OWNED-BY-NAV (2026-07-15, resolved by operator) — NOT Zod's lane.** ⚠ Recon flag (ПРОМТ №402):
this section's own analysis below predates batch R's `MethodTaxonomyPicker`/`methodTaxonomy.ts`
client-side two-level parse-over-flat-list mechanism — much of what this section asks for may already
be delivered by a different mechanism than the one specced here. Treat the text below as historical
until re-verified; do not build off it blind.

**Reality (recon 2026-07-07).** A master profile stores only a **flat `methods: list[str]`**
(`masters/service.py:81-90` `_build_data` → `data.profile.methods`; input `MasterApplyExperience`
`masters/schemas.py:60-70`). There is **no** `direction` / `type` / `вид` / `subtype` / `category`
field anywhere under `data.profile`. `AdminMasterReviewView` merely *relabels* the flat list
"Направления практик" — cosmetic, no second «Вид» axis. Direction/type exist only on **Practice**
(`data.taxonomy.direction` + `PracticeType`), not on masters.

**What F2/F6 needs (all OWNED-BY-NAV — historical spec, see recon flag above):**
1. A master-profile taxonomy shape — `direction` + `subtype (вид)` (two-level, mirroring E19's
   «Направление»→«Вид»), JSONB-additive under `data.profile` (no column migration) — or the E20
   `catalog_entries` route.
2. A master-facing way to SET them: extend `MasterApplyExperience` (apply) + the M3 change-request
   (`MethodChangeRequestSubmit` `masters/schemas.py:168-176`, currently flat `proposed_methods`) +
   the **admin edit-master-fields** endpoint already tracked at the §E19-area row
   `| admin edit-master-fields | NEW | save Направление / Вид | P2 | OPEN |` (line ~497).
3. THEN the admin **card + detail** (`AdminMastersView`, `AdminMasterReviewView`, and the
   `AdminMasterDetail` schema `admin/users/schemas.py:38-49`) render «Направление» + «Вид». Today
   they show honest `«—»` stubs — the FE structure is already built for the values to drop in.

**Cross-ref:** this IS the deferred **E19** (two-level Направление→Вид taxonomy, shipped FLAT M3
instead) + **E20** (admin-editable catalog `catalog_entries`, kind ∈ {direction, practice_type,
method}). F2/F6 cannot ship presentational — a faked taxonomy violates the E19 no-fake rule.
**Operator fork:** (B) minimal real `data.profile.direction`+`subtype` now, hardcoded option lists;
or (C) fold into E19+E20 catalog (correct, larger, unblocks CreatePractice/EditProfile picklists).

### F4 — self-deleted master candidate → `cancelled_by_user` archival. **NEW. P2. STATUS: OWNED-BY-NAV (backend, 2026-07-15) + FE branch (self, unchanged).**

**Target.** When a user with a **pending** master application deletes their account, the application
row STAYS in the DB, flips to auto-status `cancelled_by_user`, and the admin moderation queue shows
«Аккаунт удалён» with Approve/Reject **disabled**.

**Reality (recon 2026-07-07).** The precondition does **not** exist: `DELETE /api/v1/users/me`
(`users/router.py:139`) → `reset_user_to_onboarding` (`users/service.py:283`) is a documented
**no-op** — it only clears `onboarding_completed`; `is_active` untouched, all data stays, the account
still logs in. Nothing writes `cancelled_by_user` for masters (it is only a booking/diary event
today). No «Аккаунт удалён» UI branch exists.

**What F4 needs:**
1. **Backend — real deletion hook** (the single change-point is already earmarked inside
   `reset_user_to_onboarding`, `users/service.py:287-299`): on account deletion, find the user's
   MasterProfile and if `data.account.status == "pending"` write `status = "cancelled_by_user"`
   (JSONB deepcopy + `set_jsonb`, mirroring `reject_master` `admin/masters/service.py:298-303`).
   ⚠ **`MasterProfile.user_id` FK is `ondelete="CASCADE"` (`masters/models.py:59`)** — a real
   hard-delete of the User would DROP the profile row (opposite of the target). So either soft-delete
   the User (needs an `is_deleted`/`deleted_at` column = migration) or leave the User row and only
   flip the status (no migration). Decide the deletion semantics first.
2. **Frontend (self, ready to wire once the status exists):** `masterStatusLabel` already maps
   `cancelled_by_user → «Аккаунт удалён»` and the masters filter has an «Удалены» tab (F3, currently
   count 0). Still to add: an `isCancelledByUser` branch in `AdminMasterReviewView` that shows
   «Аккаунт удалён» and disables Approve/Reject (note `verify/reject_master` already 409 on
   non-pending via `_load_pending_profile`, so the guard exists server-side — the UI must disable
   rather than call).

**Dependency:** F3's «Удалены» tab stays empty until this ships; «Заблокированы» already populates
from A1's `suspended`.

## 2026-07-09 — USER SUPPORT screen shipped (frontend-only stub) → needs a ticket backend (P1)

**Frontend shipped this batch (I3, no backend touch):** a real user Support screen at route
`user-support` (`frontend/src/views/user/SupportView.vue`), reached from the profile hub «Поддержка»
(previously a stub toast). Topic picker + message + honest terminal screen. **No server call** — submit
logs a future-ready payload and points to `mailto:support@velo.app` as the live channel (mirrors the
MasterSupportView stub; it does NOT claim server delivery).

**Topic catalog (user-facing labels) + INTERNAL priority** (priority is NOT shown to the user — it is
our routing/sort signal):

| value | label | priority |
|---|---|---|
| `payment` | Проблема с оплатой / транзакцией | P1 |
| `complaint_master` | Жалоба на мастера | **P0** |
| `practice` | Проблема с практикой | P1 |
| `technical` | Технический вопрос | P2 |
| `other` (+ free-text) | Другое | P2 |

**What Zod needs to build (ticket intake):** **Lane (operator, 2026-07-15): stays Zod's** — support is
delivered THROUGH the messaging module Zod is building, not a standalone form; it is a consumer of
that module. The lane test is "ships through the messaging module", not "contains text".
- A `SupportTicket` model + migration with at least: `id`, `user_id`, `topic` (the value above),
  `priority` (**a real column** — `P0|P1|P2` or an int severity — so the queue can route/sort by it),
  `custom_topic` (nullable, for `other`), `message`, `status` (open/…); optional attachments later.
- `POST /api/v1/support/tickets` (auth = current user) accepting `{topic, message, custom_topic?}`;
  the server derives/validates `priority` from the topic (do NOT trust a client-sent priority — the
  frontend sends it only as a future-ready hint; the server is the source of truth for routing).
- Admin queue to list/sort tickets by `priority` (P0 first). MasterSupportView is the SAME stub and can
  share the ticket model once this exists.
- When live: wire `SupportView.onSubmit` to the real POST (replace the console.info stub + the honest
  terminal copy can then legitimately say the request was received).

The MASTER support form (`MasterSupportView`) is the same stub and should fold into this ticket model
too (its topics are master-oriented: withdrawal / add_direction / rejected — keep both catalogs).
