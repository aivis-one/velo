/**
 * App-root keyboard-viewport publisher. Mounted ONCE from App.vue (the
 * always-mounted root); the single visualViewport listener for CSS state.
 *
 * ANDROID FIX (batch bg-freeze, 2026-07-13 — audit ПРОМТ №378): `#app`'s
 * `100lvh` was assumed stable across the keyboard (batch K/N/root-lock), but
 * `lvh`'s keyboard-immunity depends entirely on the platform respecting
 * index.html's `interactive-widget=resizes-visual` -- a Chromium-only hint.
 * On Android WebViews that don't honour it (older "Android System WebView"
 * builds, or a host Activity using `adjustResize`), the keyboard resizes the
 * WebView's own rendering surface BEFORE the CSS engine ever sees it, so
 * `100lvh` silently degrades to tracking the shrunk surface -- #app's box (and
 * #app::before's bg, `inset:0` against it) rescales. `freezeAppHeight()`
 * below breaks that dependency entirely: it captures the viewport height ONCE
 * (before any keyboard can possibly be open) into `--velo-frozen-vh`, a plain
 * px custom property that NOTHING but this function's own writes can ever
 * change. global.css re-anchors html/body/#app/.app-frame to that var instead
 * of `100lvh` -- their height becomes immune to ANY live viewport signal, on
 * any platform, by construction (see the composable's own guardrail below:
 * this function is wired ONLY to mount + orientationchange, NEVER to a
 * visualViewport resize/scroll handler -- doing so would defeat the whole
 * point, since that IS the keyboard signal).
 *
 * The "dancing background" is fixed STRUCTURALLY now (batch K): #app::before is an
 * absolute child of #app's stable box (global.css), so it no longer tracks
 * the visual viewport and there is nothing to counter-shift per frame. This
 * composable therefore no longer writes `--velo-bg-shift` or freezes any transform.
 *
 * Its other remaining job: keyboard-aware LAYOUT. It publishes the visual-viewport
 * HEIGHT as `--velo-vvh` and toggles `is-keyboard-open`, BOTH on :root
 * (documentElement) so teleported modals (under <body>, outside #app) inherit them.
 * The gated rules in global.css cap the scroll container / modal to `--velo-vvh`
 * ONLY while that class is present. At rest the class is absent → the rules are
 * inert → layout is byte-identical. Threshold is shared with useKeyboardOpen
 * (KEYBOARD_VIEWPORT_THRESHOLD) so the two never drift. `--velo-vvh` is a
 * SEPARATE signal from `--velo-frozen-vh` above -- it stays exactly as it was,
 * live, keyboard-reactive, and is what the `.velo-kbd-scroll` scroll-cap
 * mechanism reads; it does not drive #app's height and never has.
 *
 * Writes are rAF-throttled (one style write per frame). No-ops where
 * visualViewport is absent (SSR / desktop → class never added).
 *
 * K3f — on every route change it (1) blurs the active element so a focused field
 * releases and the keyboard dismisses on navigation, (2) resets the state, and
 * (3) opens a short SUPPRESSION window during which it will NOT re-assert
 * `is-keyboard-open` / `--velo-vvh`. Without it, a still-closing keyboard fires
 * more visualViewport resizes right after the reset and repaints keyboard-open
 * geometry (the max-height cap → a fog "line" band + reflow lag) onto the freshly
 * navigated screen.
 */

 * keyboard can be open) and orientationchange (a genuine size change) ONLY.
