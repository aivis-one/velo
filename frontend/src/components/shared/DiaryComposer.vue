  VELO Frontend -- DiaryComposer (Diary redesign)

  Thin per-consumer wrapper over the shared `Composer.vue` (PROMPT №740,
  track 2 -- the extraction that also serves ChatThreadScreen). This file
  keeps DiaryComposer's OWN public contract byte-identical (props: entryType;
  emits: created, composingChange) so DiaryFeedView needs no changes at all --
  it supplies diary's three consumer-specific things the shared component
  does not know about: which store persists an entry (`send`), which
  localStorage key holds the draft (`draftKey`), and the collapsed-preview
  opt-in (`showDraftPreview`, diary-only, pre-dates this extraction).

  Visual/behavioural changes from before this extraction (owner-approved via
  .tmp/composer-unification.html): the send button now sits INSIDE the
  bordered field instead of beside it (B38); the field is solid white in
  every state instead of a translucent rail that frosts on focus (B50).
  The autogrow cap went flat (--velo-textarea-autogrow-max, 240px) in track 2
  and is VIEWPORT-AWARE AGAIN as of track 3 (PROMPT №741) via
  `useComposerGrowCap` -- same formula, same constants, same numbers as
  before this extraction (see that file). Everything else (draft persistence,
  the collapsed preview, the composingChange contract, the send/failure/
  in-flight guards) is unchanged in shape, now living in the shared component.
