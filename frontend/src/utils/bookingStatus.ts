// =============================================================================
// VELO Frontend -- Booking lifecycle helpers (shared)
// =============================================================================
//
// Single source of truth for the practice/booking lifecycle as the USER sees it,
// shared by the dashboard "Ближайшая практика" card and "Мои бронирования" so
// the two never drift.
//
// Active-cycle states (before/while the practice runs) are decided by CLIENT
// TIME (scheduled_at + duration_minutes), NOT by practice.status. The backend
// now drives status='live' and status='completed' automatically by the clock
// (the lifecycle worker: live at scheduled_at, completed at scheduled_at +
// duration), but on a poll interval — so status can lag the real moment by a
// few seconds. Driving the live/ended cycle off the clock here makes the card
// flip the instant the practice actually starts/ends, with no dependency on the
// worker's lag. The FINAL statuses (attended/no_show/cancelled) still come from
// the backend booking.status — they carry settlement truth.
//
// "now" is passed in (epoch ms) so callers control reactivity: the dashboard
// feeds a 60s clock ref; one-shot views can pass Date.now().
// =============================================================================
